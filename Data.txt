Image Credit: Graeme Robinson-Clogg 
 
In this section of the workshop, you will explore your role as an online learning student. By the end of this 
section, you will be able to: 
• Describe the characteristics of a self-directed learner. 
• Use the plan-monitor-evaluate strategy to organize and evaluate your learning.

Identify Skills for Self-Directed Learning 
Though all university courses ask students to apply independent learning strategies, online learning requires an 
even higher level of self-directed learning skill. 
Many students have experience in teacher-directed classrooms. In these classrooms, the teacher is the central 
figure, and the students take direction about what to learn directly from the instructor. In these environments, 
students might spend time taking notes on an instructor’s lecture, and might focus much of their learning time on 
memorizing concepts in preparation for recalling them on an exam. 
Online university courses are different. The instructor is no longer the central figure in the learning 
environment. You, the student, become the central actor in your own learning journey. As you undertake this 
journey, you are supported by your community of fellow students. Your instructor serves as your guide, using 
their knowledge and experience to direct you to learning experiences that will lead you to your learning goals. 
As you begin the workshop, reflect on your current self-directed learning skills. The quiz below will help you to 
get started. Complete the quiz before continuing on in the workshop below. If you are unable to view or complete 
the quiz, please access this activity in an alternative format.

Skills for Independent Learning 
 
5
Image Credit: Rawia Inaim 
 
Independent learning requires the following skills: 
• Defining your learning goal for your program, each course, and each assignment you complete. 
• Identifying the steps you must take to move towards your goal. What content do you need to know? How 
will you learn it? 
• Choose strategies that will support your own learning. 
• Reach out for the support you need from your instructor, classmates, and university support services. 
In the next section, you will explore the ways that a skill called metacognition supports you in becoming an 
independent learner.

Learning Progress 
What is Metacognition? 
What is Metacognition? 
Have you ever wondered what the most successful students do differently from other students? Students who have 
developed effective ways of learning have mastered a skill called metacognition. In simple terms, metacognition is 
understanding your own thinking and learning processes.  In other words, it is “thinking about your thinking”. 
Metacognitive skills include planning your learning, monitoring whether your current learning strategies are 
successful, and evaluating results of your learning. Improving your metacognitive skills is associated with 
increased success in all of your academic life. To learn more about how metacognition applies to student life, 
watch the video below. 
 
Learning Choices: Videos and Text 
At several points in the workshop, you will have the opportunity to learn key skills by watching a short video. If you prefer reading 
to watching videos, you will find a video transcript located directly below each video. Scroll past the video to read if this is your 
learning preference. 
 
One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view them online here: 
https://kpu.pressbooks.pub/learningtolearnonline/?p=29#oembed-1 
 
How do you gain the skill of metacognition? One way to think about developing metacognition is gaining the 
ability to plan, monitor, and evaluate your learning.

The Learning Cycle (Image Credit: Christina Page) 
Planning involves two key tasks: deciding what you need to learn, and 
then deciding how you are going to learn that material. 
Monitoring requires you to ask “how am I doing at learning this?”. In 
monitoring, you are constantly tracking what you have learned, what 
you don’t yet know, and whether your study strategies are helping you 
to learn effectively. 
Evaluation involves reflection on how well you met your Learning 
Objectives after completing a unit of study, or receiving feedback (such 
as a test or assignment). 
 
Key Questions to Improve Your Learning

Use Critical Questioning to Support Your Learning 
Learning in an online environment requires you to move beyond simple memorization of course concepts. To 
gain knowledge that will support you in your growth as a lifelong learner and in your future career, you will want 
to interact with course concepts deeply and in ways that are personally relevant to you. 
One way of picturing deeper learning is Bloom’s Taxonomy. 
 
Image Credit: Rawia Inaim 
 
The levels of Bloom’s taxonomy build upon each other. While you need to be able to remember key concepts, 
your courses will spend more time developing your ability to apply, analyze, evaluate, and create using this 
10
knowledge. As you encounter new concepts, you will want to use critical questioning to understand the concepts 
at all levels, moving from surface to deeper knowledge. The chart below includes some questions that might be 
relevant at each level.

One method for creating study questions or planning active learning activities is to move step-by-step through each level 
of Bloom’s Taxonomy.  Begin with a few questions at the Remembering level. If you don’t yet know the technical language 
of the subject and what it means, it will be difficult for you to apply, evaluate, analyze, or be creative. Then, go deeper into 
your subject as you move through the levels.  Learning at university requires you to learn the basics of your discipline by 
remembering and understanding; however, you will spend much more of your time applying, analyzing, evaluating, and 
creating. 
Here is an example of what this might look like.  What questions can you create for your topic?

Manage Information for Online Learning 
As you develop your identity as an online learner, you will want to consider the role of information management 
in your learning process. Strong independent learners actively read, evaluate, and use information for current 
course tasks, but more importantly, to develop a resource file of information that will support professional growth. 
Many online learners feel overwhelmed at the volume of reading and the wealth of online resources available 
to them. Managing information well requires you to develop skills in identifying the purpose for your reading 
(What do you need to learn from this reading? Why is it important to you personally and professionally?), and the 
strategy that will help you achieve your purpose (skimming, reading key portions, a close reading). In the Strategic 
Reading module of this workshop, you will discover additional ways to manage the reading process. 
Early in your learning journey, you will want to select a system for managing information. As you will frequently 
work with electronic texts and articles, selecting a system that allows you to store, search, and retrieve readings and 
notes from current and past courses.  Online note systems, such as OneNote or Evernote, are highly effective for 
this purpose. 
 
Benefits of Using an Online Notebook 
Online notebook platforms allow you to do the following: 
• Create individual notebooks for courses or assignments, creating additional sections or pages for weekly 
module topics 
• Create flexible notes that include text, images, audio, and video files 
• Store PDFs and other course documents for your own records (note: you will eventually lose access to 
Moodle pages when courses are complete) 
• Clip and store relevant information from the web 
• Search stored content to quickly find relevant information, making connections between courses and 
your previous learning 
• Sync notes across all of your devices 
 
Choose a Notebook 
Two fully-featured and common software platforms are Onenote and Evernote 
 
14
Advantages 
Disadvantages 
OneNote 
-Included in Office 365 subscriptions (free to KPU students) 
-Mac version is less fully featured 
Evernote 
*Used under license from Evernote 
Corporation 
-Simple interface is easy to learn and use 
-Basic version is free, but additional features require an 
annual subscription 
 
To evaluate which platform best serves your needs, you may wish to investigate by trying out each on your 
preferred devices.  You may also wish to explore the following linked video tutorials for further information, and 
to begin developing your organizational system.

[PART II] 
Who am I on my Learning Journey with? 
Image Credit: Graeme Robinson-Clogg 
 
While you are on your own unique learning journey, much of your learning will come through your interactions 
with your fellow students.  In preparation for your future career in a collaborative professional context, much 
of your learning will take place in groups.  In some disciplines, this process is referred to as becoming part of a 
community of inquiry or community of practice. 
By the end of this module, you will be able to: 
• Define the role of a the learning community in your online program. 
• Understand processes that shape effective team interactions. 
• Plan your strategy for working effectively in teams. 
Go to the next chapter to move on in the workshop.

[5] 
Define Your Learning Community 
When you join an online course, you become part of what is known as a Community of Inquiry. In the 
Community of Inquiry, you will have an Instructor, content to process, and a learning community in which to 
grow. 
This is a learning community that fosters your learning (cognitive growth), in a way that allows you to apply new 
insights to your life and work. Within a Community of Inquiry, learners have two key roles: 
1. Maintaining a cognitive presence in the community. This requires a continual process of critical 
thinking. 
2. Developing a social presence in the learning community. This involves creating the open and mutual 
relationships that allow for learning and collaboration to occur. 
 
Cognitive Presence and Critical Thinking 
How does learning happen? Is it the result of reading, 
memorizing, and taking exams? While many learning 
experiences have these components, the best kind of 
learning involves constructing new knowledge in a learning 
community. This requires interacting with new information 
(for example, from readings, discussions, videos, and 
lectures). 
You  
may 
receive 
this 
information 
with 
instructors, from fellow students, or you may search it out 
to solve questions or problems. Then, together with your 
learning community, you make connections between this 
new knowledge and your prior experiences. You also 
determine how this new knowledge will shape your 
professional practice. 
The Community of Inquiry supports this process through 
the exchange of ideas, supporting one another exploring 
connections, and challenging ways of thinking through 
thoughtful questioning. 
 
Social Presence 
If learning occurs in a collaborative community, how does this take place online? Maintaining a social presence 
in an online environment involves allowing for open communication. Social presence allows you to risk 
expressing your ideas online, based on the knowledge that your classmates will be respectful and supportive. All 
members of the community commit to supporting each other in their learning. Though it may be difficult to 
express some nuances and emotions online, using emoticons can help. 1

Group work is also a key part of the Community of Inquiry experience. The best online learning experiences 
happen when you are able to form connections within a team as you work towards your learning goals. The next 
sections of this module provide strategies for developing your learning community in the context of group work 
and team development.

Understand the Principles of Effective Teamwork 
Alice Macpherson 
Now that you have identified what you hope to achieve through teamwork in your learning community, consider 
how you will form effective teams. 
Five Basic Elements of Effective Teams 
Image Credit: Rawia Inaim 
 
Effective teams share five key characteristics: 
Positive Interdependence 
 
Members believe they are linked together; they cannot succeed unless the other members of the group 
succeed (and vice versa). 
They sink or swim together. 
Individual Accountability 
The performance of each individual member is assessed and the results given back to the group and the 
individual 
Group Processing 
At the end of its working period, the group processes it’s functioning by answering two questions: 
• 
What did each member do that was helpful for the group? 
• 
What can each member do to make the group work better? 
Skills in Communication 
Necessary for effective group functioning. 
Members must have – and use – the needed leadership, decision-making, trust-building, communication, 
and conflict-management skills. 
Promotive Interaction 
 
Members help, assist, encourage, and support each other’s efforts to learn.1 
 
 
Complete the quiz below to strengthen your knowledge of the five elements of effective teams.

Plan for Successful Teamwork 
Alice Macpherson and Christina Page 
Tuckman suggested that teams move through stages in their life cycle: forming, storming, norming, and 
performing. At each stage, the group will work through a series of interpersonal tasks, as well as a series of project-
related tasks. 
 
Image Credit: Alice Macpherson and Rawia Inaim 
 
In the first section of this module, you explored the components of a Community of Inquiry. Both cognitive 
presence and social presence are required in the online learning community. Tuckman’s model of team 
development also indicates that both components are needed. In a class-based team, it may be easy to focus 
only on the cognitive output of the group – the creation of the project, paper, or presentation. However, as you 
can observe from Tuckman’s model, a well-functioning team requires its members to exhibit social presence 
throughout, communicating well in interpersonal interactions. 
In the days ahead, you will likely find yourself on a newly forming team in an online environment. Consider 
the strategies you plan to use to demonstrate social presence and form a strong interpersonal foundation for your 
newly forming team.

Progress Through the Stages of Team Development 
Alice Macpherson and Christina Page 
As your group moves through these stages, stay aware of the patterns that tend to occur at each stage. For example, 
many teams falsely assume that their group cannot function when they find themselves at the storming stage. 
However, this stage is a normal part of team development, like the others. The info-graphic below indicates what

Becoming a Team 
A Team is two or more people; working together; on a Common Goal (or goals). Groups become Teams if the common 
goals are clear and attention is paid to both interpersonal and task functions. 
The Team must Decide how to Communicate Effectively (Interpersonal) 
Each Team must set up their own guidelines for good communication and a Team Charter. Through discussion and 
negotiation the members choose the items that are most important for their clear communication as a Team. These often 
include commitment to: 
• Respect and Listen to others 
• Not blame (work hard on the problem, not on the person) 
• Group members and Project process 
• Supportive and Constructive Feedback 
• Agreed upon Goals and Clear Timelines 
• Positive interdependence (sink or swim together) 
• Individual Accountability (say what you will do and do it) 
• Analysis of work done and Planning for next steps 
• Process for conflict and Problem Management 
The Team must Decide what is Important and Measure This (Task) 
Early in the formation of the group, the members must decide what will be measured in the process. These items are 
generally critical to success and for the group to become an Effective Team.  A team that has succeeded shares the 
following characteristics.  Its members: 
• Came prepared 
• Offered ideas and suggestions, Provided information 
• Asked for clarification/feedback 
• Identified resources 
• Solicited others’ participation 
• Kept group on task 
• Was easy to work with 
• Prepared materials 
• Made presentation 
• Participated in discussions 
• Managed group conflict 
The Team must Acknowledge Success and Aim for Improvement 
What have we done (individually and collectively) to meet our goals and keep the Team Charter? 
How can we do better for next time? (Next steps) 
The Team Celebrates! 
Celebrate what you have accomplished and then refocus your efforts for greater success!

Framework for Working Together 
Core Values 
Your personal beliefs are the core values that affect and drive how you look at the world, your behaviour in the 
world and your interaction with others. They are how you do “business” with the rest of the world. In other words, 
they are the basis for everything that you are and do. These beliefs about appropriate behaviours, attitudes and 
strategies also guide every working group and need to be explicit and understood. 
Mandate 
It is useful to know what you are expected to do in a group situation. This is often delivered or requested from 
an administrative or political level and appears in the form of a “job description”. The group which is mandated 
may not be able to effect the general outline of the mandate. The context in which the group operates has critical 
effects on what can be done. 
Identifying a Mission Statement 
A mission statement embodies the group’s current purpose and intent and answers (within the mandate of the 
group) questions such as: What are we about? Why are we working together? What do we want to achieve? It 
describes the business that you are in. This may be a statement developed by the whole organization or it may be 
more localized in a department, program, class, work group or individually. It gives direction to actions. Without 
knowing your mission, you may not be able to get started. 
Developing Shared Vision 
Vision is a future oriented statement of a group’s purpose in a task, project or work team. Having the members 
shared a vision that aligns with their personal values and aspirations is a solid basis for production. Time spent at 
the beginning in dreaming and discussing what the final result will be is time well spent. If it is not possible to have 
a shared vision of the end product and the goals and milestones that must be reached then the team may also have 
difficulty identifying whether they have accomplished their purpose. 
Sometimes, when the project is open ended or ongoing, the final product cannot be totally “visioned” at the 
beginning. A shared vision will then be one that all of the team members agree are the elements of where they 
want to get at this time and the direction that they will start moving towards to achieve these elements. 
Visions should be revisited and refined over time. If the team is not heading in the same direction, then it may 
not get anywhere. 
Determining Appropriate Goals 
What are the individual tasks and goals that will build to making your vision manifest? Goals lead towards 
the realization of the vision. It is important to develop appropriate goals, make them explicit and share an 
understanding of each one. 
Goals have: 
• Targets – where we expect to get to realistically balanced with time and resources. 
• Objectives – identifiable, measurable and achievable steps. 
• Tasks – ways of reaching the objectives. 
• Indicators – ways of measuring progress. 
Like our vision statement, goals need to be realigned with reality on a regular basis. Evaluation and adjustment 
drive this process. 
Improving Continuously 
Knowing where you are going and how you intend to get there is a good start. The final step is continuous 
improvement. Planning, implementation, and verification are tools for analysis and change as the process unfolds. 
30  KPU Learning Centres
Improvement is continual but the steps are small. Pick changes that can be made now that will have a positive 
effect – 1% is enough each time.

Who are my Instructors? What is Their Role? 
Image Credit: Graeme Robinson-Clogg 
 
The online learning journey requires a different relationship to instructors than you may have experienced in 
the past. You may  not see your instructors as regularly face to face, yet you can still develop effective relationships 
with instructors that support you in your learning.  By the end of this module, you will be able to: 
• Describe the role of an online instructor. 
• Develop an effective student-instructor connection.

Describe the Role of an Online Instructor 
As you have already learned, when you join an online 
course, you become part of what is known as a Community 
of Inquiry and you take on an important role in this online 
learning environment. 
What is the role of your instructor in this learning 
environment?  Your online instructor provides the teaching 
presence to create design significant learning experiences 
for you and your fellow students.  Instructors also 
thoughtfully facilitate the content that will support your 
learning in the class. They also direct you by answering 
questions and challenging your assumptions to help you 
grow in your knowledge and skills. 
In 
online classrooms, your instructor takes on the following 
roles: 
• Designer:  In a museum, a curator locates the best 
artifacts to create an effective experience for those 
who visit. In an online learning environment, your 
instructors take on the role like that of a curator as 
they design the course.  They will guide you 
towards readings and other learning materials that 
will serve your learning goals.  Based on their 
experience in their field, they are able to help you 
focus your attention on learning resources that are 
accurate and relevant. 
• Facilitator:  Your instructor carefully creates 
opportunities for you to learn the skills you need for your future career, and designs assignments and 
learning activities to lead you towards intellectual, personal, and professional growth. As you review the 
course presentation, consider each of the learning activities and assignments.  Think about the reasons 
why your instructor may have selected these course components to contribute to your development. 
• Director: Online instructors are available to answer questions along the way. As you learn, you will 
inevitably find areas that are unclear to you, either related to the course content or your learning 
process.  By communicating with your instructor effectively, you will take full advantage of their role in 
35
guiding you on your journey.1 
 
For Reflection 
Now that you have considered the roles of your online instructor, consider how these roles will shape your work as a student, and 
your relationship with the instructor.

Develop an Effective Student-Instructor Connection 
Image Credit: Rawia Inaim 
 
Now that you have developed a picture of the role that your instructors will have in your online learning journey, 
how might you develop an effective relationship with them. Consider the following suggestions: 
1. When you look at a course reading, activity, or assignment, try to put yourself inside the mind of your 
instructor. Why do you think they chose this particular learning experience for you? What do you think 
they intend for you to learn? Understanding the purpose of a learning activity can increase your 
motivation and help you to stay on track in your work. 
2. Take advantage of opportunities to connect with your instructor, either face to face or during online 
office hours. You can attend office hours to clarify course difficulties, but also to build your relationship 
with your instructor and demonstrate your interest in the course material. 
3. Check the course site regularly. Your instructor is likely to post announcements and other key messages 
for the class. This provides another point of frequent contact. 
4. Use email effectively to connect. You will learn more about how to construct an effective email in the 
section on professional communication in this workshop – but if you are curious, you may choose to 
view the chapter on how to email an instructor now. 
5. When you receive feedback on an assignment, consider it carefully. How does your instructor want to 
see you grow in your academic or professional skills?

Time Management for Online Learning 
Image Credit: Graeme Robinson-Clogg 
 
Online learning requires effective time management skills.  You may not have the structure of a weekly class 
to help you organize your time and prioritize your assignments.  If you are in a blended course, you will be 
responsible for a higher number of independent self-study hours than in traditional classroom courses. 
How will you manage your time?  In this module, you will explore strategies for organizing work throughout 
the semester, developing a realistic study schedule, and balancing your online learning with your work or other 
commitments.

Use Your Course Presentations to Understand the Shape of 
Your Semester 
Online courses often provide you with a great deal of flexibility in organizing your time. This can be a tremendous 
asset, particularly if you are balancing study with work, family, or other commitments. However, this also requires 
you to accurately determine how much work you must complete over the semester, and to develop a plan that 
allows you to complete this work effectively. 
Many students find it helpful to develop a semester schedule that provides an “overview at a glance” of what will 
be required. You will find the information you need for this in your course presentations. 
The following video will help you to better understand how to read your course presentation and how to plan 
for the semester ahead.

Video Transcript: Creating a Semester Schedule 
Creating a master schedule for your whole semester can help you to see the big picture and to stay on track. In 
this video, you will learn how to compile the information from your course presentations into one master 
schedule that will allow you to see your semester at a glance. 
Here are 3 STEPS you can take to use your course presentations to create a semester schedule. 
Step 1: Create a table with 7 columns, one column for each day of the week, and with one rows for each week of 
the semester. Label the days, Monday, Tuesday, and all the way along, across the top of the table. Then label the 
weeks, across the side of the table. At this point you can also add specific dates for each week of the semester. You 
can download a ready-made semester schedule by clicking in the description of this video. 
Step 2: Next, gather up all of your course presentations for the semester. You should have one for each course 
you are taking, which includes details about the weekly schedule and readings, assignment due dates, and exams. 
If you have a part time job, and know your schedule, and if you have family commitments which have a regular 
schedule, gather up these schedules as well. 
Step 3: Now, go through the course presentation looking for important details and commitments that will take 
place in Week 1 of the semester. This could include required course readings, homework and assignments. On 
your semester schedule table, find the day of the week these commitments need to be completed by and write 
them down. Make sure to include the course name, the details of the commitment, and what it is worth if it is 
a graded assignment. Now keep working through your course presentation, through each week of the semester. 
Keep following these same steps for each of your courses, until you have completed your schedule. 
41
Now, add important life events to your semester schedule – this might include work events, family events, trips 
and special occasions. 
In summary, once you have completed these 3 steps using your course presentations to create a semester 
schedule, you will now have a central and easily accessible schedule that includes all of your commitments, in 
one place. You won’t have to go searching through piles of paper, or back online through the course website, to 
remember what you have to get done each week. As well, being able to see, in one place, what your commitments 
are today, this week, and in the upcoming weeks, can help you organize your time in the most efficient way 
possible.

Create a Semester Schedule 
A semester schedule gives you a visual picture of the assignments, projects, tests, exams, presentations, and 
practicum requirements that will happen during the semester. If you are taking a number of classes, this is a tool 
to be able to see what is coming up next. 
By having the “big picture” in view, you will be able to proactively manage busy periods in your semester.  If you 
have flexible due dates, you will be able to schedule your assignments for the optimal time in the semester. For 
example, you may notice that you have a larger than typical number of major assignments due in week 6. This 
allows you to schedule work on some of these projects earlier in the semester. 
Look at the example semester schedule below. What do you  notice about what the student chose to include? 
What will you include on your semester schedule? After viewing the example schedule below, download the 
semester schedule template to create your own schedule. When you have completed your schedule, go to the next 
chapter to move ahead.

Develop a Weekly Schedule That Works 
Your next step is to create a weekly schedule. This will include your class times for face to face or blended classes, 
work commitments, volunteer roles, practicum placements, as well as any other regular events in your week. A 
weekly schedule is a good tool to evaluate whether your time use allows you to meet your overall goals. Do you 
have enough time for study? Is there time to maintain a healthy lifestyle? Analyze the example student schedule 
below. What do you notice about how this student has planned their week? 
 
Image credit: Rawia Inaim 
 
Download the weekly schedule template here. The following principles will guide you as you create your weekly 
schedule: 
1. Record your regular weekly commitments on the schedule template. This includes any face to face or 
45
blended class times. 
2. Designate regular study blocks for each of your classes. Remember that university courses typically 
require at least 9-12 hours of weekly study. Remember that it is more effective to study for multiple, 
shorter blocks of time during the week than to plan for one extended study block. Shorter study periods 
will allow for greater focus. Regular review will help you retain information well. 
3. Record meal times, family times, laundry times, etc. 
4. Record all regularly scheduled personal activities such as meetings, employment and athletics. 
5. Record any special activities you need to do or want to do on a regular basis. 
6. Schedule to start your study period with the courses you like least or that you’re not doing well in. Try 
to study the same subjects at the same time each study day. Although this seems to be a mechanical way 
of scheduling, you will find that such a routine can help you develop a pattern for efficient and effective 
learning. 
7. Schedule a weekly review (WR) for each course. Do it at the end of the week if possible. This weekly 
review gives you an opportunity to go over the past week’s notes along with the reading assignments to 
see what you have been learning in the past week during class and study time for each course. You can 
also look ahead to plan the next week and determine how much reading you need to do, what projects 
are due, and if any tests are scheduled. 
8. Keep open some time for daily physical activity. Remember, research indicates that regular exercise will 
not only give you a general sense of well-being, but can reduce tension and help you accomplish a 
tough class, study, and work schedule. 
9. Label some empty blocks of time as OPEN for academic or personal needs. 
10. Schedule some time during Friday, Saturday, and Sunday for you to play, relax, or do whatever you 
want to do. This is your reward for sticking to your schedule. In addition, you’ll enjoy your free time 
more. Because it is scheduled you do not need to feel guilty. 
Try it! 
Download the weekly schedule template. Create your weekly schedule based on the principles you have explored in this chapter. 
Follow your schedule for a two week period. Then, evaluate and make adjustments.

Manage Daily Tasks 
Now that you can see the big picture of your semester and weekly priorities, the next step is to create a daily to-do 
list to prioritize your tasks. The video below introduces you to some principles for creating daily task lists. When 
you are finished, move to the next section to choose strategies for managing your tasks.

Managing Daily Tasks Video Transcript 
By the time you’ve finished the day today, what will you have accomplished? In this video, you will learn to 
create a system to manage your daily to-do list, so that you can prioritize effectively and use your time efficiently. 
For every task you have to complete, you need to decide: 
1.     When do I need to finish this by? 
2.     How much time will it take? 
3.     Is this task a priority, or can it wait until later? 
A good to-do list helps you make sure that you complete all of your high priority tasks, and that you allocate 
a manageable amount of work to each day. So, how do you make a daily task list? First, you will want to find the 
format that works best for you. Some people prefer to use a paper planner. Others prefer to use the reminders 
function on their phone, or another task list app. Choose the format that meets your needs the best. Second, you 
will need to divide your work into tasks that are specific, measurable, and achievable. In general, a task should 
be anything that you can complete in a single work period – for example, in an hour or less.  If you have a large 
project, break it down into smaller tasks. 
Third, you will need to assign your tasks to a specific day. Make sure that each day’s task list is reasonable and 
achievable. 
Fourth, prioritize each day’s tasks. What tasks must be finished today. Be sure that you complete these before 
moving on to lower priority tasks. After the most important things have been done, move on to the less urgent 
tasks. 
At the end of the day, decide what to do with any tasks that aren’t yet complete. Most often, you will move the 
task to another day. You might also decide that the task isn’t important, and delete it from your list. 
Finally, be sure to reward yourself for a day’s work well done. If you are able to create an effective motivational 
system for yourself, you will be less likely to procrastinate, and more likely to finish your most important work 
each day. 
To summarize, a daily to-do list can help you stay on track and achieve your most important goals. Choose a 
tool that works for you, organize your tasks, prioritize them, and work through your list each day.

Choose a Daily Task Management System 
Some students prefer paper-based task management systems, while others prefer to use technology to manage 
daily tasks.  Consider the following advantages and disadvantages of systems you might choose.

integrated in a single view 
• Information is easily viewable on multiple 
devices 
• Easy to schedule meetings with team 
members or share events 
• May be difficult to integrate smaller tasks into the 
work plan 
• May be difficult to move incomplete tasks to a new 
time slot on a later date 
Time management app (e.g. Wunderlist, Remember 
the Milk, Microsoft To-Do) 
• Information can viewed on multiple devices 
• Most apps allow project lists to be shared 
between team members 
• Easy to integrate small tasks into the daily 
task list 
• Easy to mark task completion 
• Incomplete tasks can be rescheduled simply 
• May require time to learn the platform 
• Apps may become obsolete 
• Some apps require payment 
 
Reflection and Action 
Consider what kind of task management system will help you most in your current study program: 
1. What kind of time management system do you prefer? Paper or technology-based? 
2. Do you plan to keep your current time management system, or make some changes to support your online learning? If 
you are trying a new system, when will you evaluate how effective it is for you? 
3. When will you organize your daily tasks? Will you set aside a longer block of time on a weekly basis for planning, or set 
aside a few moments for planning at the beginning or end of each day?

Make Use of Small Blocks of Time 
Through using smaller blocks of time you can cover material in chunks (more on the next page) and not have to 
worry about the larger whole. A mistake that many people make is that they try to cram information into their 
minds in one large session. This isn’t a successful strategy for most students. 
Look for smaller blocks of time to study. If you are a public transit user, you can likely spend 20 minutes on 
your bus ride to read or review for your upcoming class or exam. You could even listen to an audio recording of 
your notes. In the evening, instead of watching three episodes of your favourite TV show, you could watch one and 
spend the remaining time preparing for your studies. Going out to eat often? Consider making something simple 
at home that you could put in the oven to cook without needing tending to; that time could be used doing some 
work for class and still leave you time for other activities once dinner is done. 
Making time for your studies can be overwhelming. The following video introduces you to ways to use smaller 
blocks of time to get your tasks done, while not using up numerous hours at once.

Video Transcript:  Using Small Blocks of Time Productively 
One trick to balancing work and study is taking advantage of small blocks of time to get things done. 
In this video, you will consider the small blocks of time in your schedule, and identify strategies to increase your 
productivity during these moments in your day. 
Often, we think we need to have a lot of time available for study, or we think that we can only study at home or 
in the library. By adjusting your thinking, you’ll be able to open up additional productive learning time. 
• Do you commute by transit? Though it wouldn’t be ideal to try to master detailed or complicated reading 
material on the bus, perhaps you can do some initial scanning or skimming while in transit, to prepare 
yourself for class or deeper reading later. 
• Consider creating flash cards for material that you need to learn. You can take a set of flash cards with you 
and work whenever a few minutes become available.  If you use one of the many flash card or self-testing 
apps available on your phone, you’ll be able to easily pull out your phone and make use of those small 
blocks of time. 
• Self-testing is one of the most effective ways to learn. Create a list of study questions for your course. Pull 
out the list when you have time available, and review a few questions.  Keep track of those you answer 
49
correctly, and those you need to study more. 
• Does your course include access to online videos that explain and review key concepts? Watch a video or 
two to review, or to improve your understanding of a key course idea. 
• Some courses also include access to online self-study questions. Try answering a few review questions in 
your spare moments. These online quizzes usually provide immediate feedback on what you understand, 
and what you should study further. 
• Do you like to learn by listening? Make an audio recording of the important points you want to 
remember, and listen while you commute or exercise. Maybe audio books are for you – are any of your 
course materials available in this format?

Use Email in the Online Learning Environment 
In an online learning environment, communicating by email is an important part of getting things done.  For 
many students, emailing instructors can be intimidating, at least at first.  The video below, which includes an 
interactive quiz, will provide you with some tools for sending a clear and professional email.  You will use many 
of these same principles for your communication with classmates, and in other work settings.

Video Transcript 
Communicating with your instructor throughout the semester is an important part of being an active and 
engaged post-secondary student. Email is by far the most popular means by which this type of communication 
takes place. For students, emailing instructors is particularly appealing because it is familiar, easy and convenient. 
But messages sent via email can easily be misunderstood unless special care is taken in their composition. 
To avoid confusion, and to make it as easy for your busy instructors to read and understand your email as 
possible, there are a few basic principles to keep in mind when sending an email message to your professor. In this 
video, we are going to cover five of these principles that will help ensure that your email communication is clear, 
effective, and professional. 
First, it is important to use a formal, professional tone when emailing your instructor. Include an informative 
subject, and avoid simply saying “hey” or “hello” For example, if your instructor’s name was Tom Smith, an 
email to them might look something like “Dear Professor Smith.”  You may wish to conclude with a closing like 
“best regards”.  In general, don’t worry about being too formal with your instructor. Think of your email as a 
professional, business communication. 
Second, make sure that your email is grammatically correct. You should think about your email as a chance 
to show your instructor that you care about the class, and that you are willing to take the time to proofread 
your message before sending it. It is also a good idea to break your message up into multiple paragraphs with 
appropriate punctuation. This makes your email easier to read, and it helps to avoid unnecessary confusion. 
Remember, your instructor is much more likely to help you if they are able to understand what you are saying. 
Third, it is helpful to keep your message brief. Avoid long emails that go into too many unnecessary details or 
that appear to be long-winded rants. Keep your tone friendly and respectful, and keep your emails concise and to 
the point. With that said, it is also not a good idea to be too short with your message, as shortness can sometimes 
be misinterpreted as rudeness. 
Fourth, it is a good idea to make sure that you actually need to send the email in the first place. Sometimes, 
53
simply reading through your syllabus, assignment description, class website, or lecture notes can answer many of 
the questions you might have. 
Finally, it is important not to expect that your instructor will response to you immediately. Unlike with instant 
messaging, email responses can take anywhere from one to three days. Your instructors have a lot of email to 
respond to, along with their other responsibilities, so patience is advisable. Moreover, it is important to only re-
send an email after at least five days have passed. 
In this video, we covered five key principles that, if followed when writing an email to your instructor, will help 
ensure that you communicate clearly, effectively, and professionally.

Communicate in Online Forums 
Many online courses include forums, either as a required assignment, or to support your learning process. How 
can you use forums to support your learning in the best way possible? 
Earlier in the workshop, you encountered the social presence and cognitive presence elements of the 
community of inquiry you are building in your course. Forums are a tool for creating collaborative learning 
relationships.  They can also be a low-stakes way to express your developing ideas, and to get feedback on the ways 
in which you are learning the course material as you work towards larger assignments. 
 
What Makes a Good Forum Post? 
The rubric below outlines what distinguishes stronger online posts from those that are less successful. Review 
the chart below.  What do you notice?  If your instructor has provided a rubric for online posts, read the rubric, 
and identify your instructor’s criteria for success.1

Tips for Participating in Forums 
1. Develop a clear understanding of the expectations and ground rules for the forum. Review your course 
presentation (syllabus) to guidance on how often to post, the type of content to include in each post, and the 
best way to respond to others’ posts. 
2. Make connections between your posts and the content you are learning in the course. A forum post is often 
an excellent place to engage in critical reflection.  Make connections between the course content and the ways 
that your growing understanding are shaping your present and future practice. 
3. Set a regular schedule for posting and commenting on forums. This prevents the amount of content from 
becoming overwhelming, and allows you to develop stronger relationships in the course by regularly engaging 
with classmates. 
4. Include resources that might be useful to other classmates or your instructor in your posts. 
5. Use language that is appropriate for an academic environment.  Avoid writing in a way that is too informal (ie. 
writing that resembles a text message). 
6. Make sure that each post is clearly written and well structured.  Take time to clarify the message you want to 
communicate in your post, and organize your content into clear and concise paragraphs.  This is easier for 
your reader than a long or disorganized post. 
7. Respond to others’ posts in a supportive and challenging way.  In writing, messages may be unintentionally 
misinterpreted.  Be sure that your responses to others are respectful, positive in tone, and do not appear 
angry, even when you wish to disagree or present an alternative viewpoint. 
8. Participate in the community discussion.  Read others’ comments before posting, and connect your ideas with 
what you are hearing from your classmates. 2 
For Reflection 
Read through your course presentations and find any guidelines for posting to forums. Create a checklist for yourself based on 
these guidelines and the rubric above. What do you need to do to create successful forum posts in your course? Keep this checklist, 
and refer to it regularly as you post to forums.

Give and Receive Feedback 
Alice Macpherson and Christina Page 
Good communication and learning in an online environment requires giving and receiving feedback. You might 
give feedback to classmates in a group project, or receive feedback from your classmates and instructors.  What 
strategies can help you use feedback most effectively? 
 
Effective feedback must include: 
What is being done correctly and well. 
How it can be improved. 
What the next steps might be. 
 
Receiving Feedback 
If another person offers you feedback, it may sound like 
criticism. It may be that they intend to be positive but they 
may not know how to say something positively. It may also 
be that their self-esteem is low and they are being defensive 
or aggressive towards you. Most importantly, you may 
become defensive or aggressive if you see their feedback as 
critical or negative, no matter what was meant. 
Attempt to suspend your reaction until you understand the information that is being given. Paraphrase what 
you hear. If it seems unclear, ask for clarification. Having it presented in other words or from another point of 
view may increase your understanding about what is being said. 
Explore and discover the reasons for the comments. 
• Is a change by you indicated? 
• Is it an evaluation of the past or an indication for the future? 
Think about and cope with your possible defensive reaction. 
• Do you see wants as demands? 
• Do you feel guilty or obligated? 
• Are you hearing more than is being said? 
Ideally, listen to his/her comments and find the positive side of them. Then, explain your position or point of view 
without feeling that you must justify yourself. Determine the importance of the message to you. You may choose 
not to change. 
57
Any discussion will profit from more information. You can wall yourself away from information and change by 
being defensive. You may open new lines of communication by being open. 
 
Giving Positive Feedback 
It is easy to criticize and to think that we are helping a person deal with a situation. To give the right commentary, 
at the right time, to the right person, with the right reasons, in the right way, and to the right degree is very 
difficult. 
You first need agreement to interact. If the other person is not ready to hear your comments, you set up a 
negative interaction that will cause them to block you and your opinions out. If you do not have permission to 
comment, you may be seen as aggressive and the other person may respond by being aggressive or defensive 
towards you. 
Ask if the other person wants your feedback. If they say no, then you will have to discuss or problem-solve that 
before you say anything more, or you will say nothing at all. 
Search out all the facts you can prior to giving your feedback. Ask the people involved about what they feel is 
happening and how they see the situation. This may solve or help to solve the problem. 
Time the discussion so that you are all reasonably unstressed. Leave time so there is another chance to talk 
before a parting of ways. This will help to avoid or clear misunderstanding or confusion. 
Be Positive. Try to begin and end your feedback with comments about what is working, correct, or right about 
the situation. No matter how bad you perceive things to be, there will be good points to comment on. 
Avoid using absolutes or negative words, words like always or never or don’t. Each situation tends to be many 
shades of grey rather than black and white. Actions taken are seen by each person in the light of his/her own 
experiences and perceptions. Use alternative positive words and phrases. Avoid comparing the person involved to 
other people in other situations. The where, when, what, and who of each situation are different. Comparisons tend 
to produce resentment and frustration. 
Be Specific in your description of the problem. Avoid vague or misleading statements. If attitude seems to be a 
problem, show specific instances and then take one point at a time so as not to overload or overwhelm the other 
person. Make sure that it is something that can be changed. 
When you tell someone that you feel they could improve or change, then also make suggestions on how you 
think they might go about making those changes, and what behaviour would be observed if the changes were 
made. Be prepared for no change. 
Feedback can be positive if it: 
• is offered at the right time and place, 
• is offered with comments on good points as well as possible changes, 
• is connected to facts and not rumours, 
• is directed to behaviour that can be changed, 
• is specific and one point at a time, and 
• gives information and possible solutions to change the situation. 
You will not use all of these items in all circumstances, but all of them can be used in some situations.

Learn with ePortfolios 
Image Credit: Rawia Inaim 
 
Many online courses include the opportunity to learn and demonstrate your learning with ePortfolios.  To get 
started with your ePortfolio, you may need to learn to use an online tool:  Mahara and WordPress are two 
commonly used tools.  Though ePortfolio assignments differ from class to class, there are some advantages to 
producing portfolios — both for your classes, and to extend your professional learning.  Eportfolios offer the 
following benefits: 
• By recording your learning regularly, you are able to show your growth as a learner and a professional 
over time. 
• Eportfolios allow you to show and reflect on your learning process.  While other assignments focus on 
60
the final product, an eportfolio allows you to record reflections, weekly learnings, and to document the 
changes in your learning and practice over a semester. 
• The process of considering the content to include and the best way to present it is itself a learning 
experience.  By consolidating your learning from different course activities and assignments, and 
applying your learning to your past experience, present personal goals, and future practice, you are 
engaging in meaningful life-long learning. 
• Eportfolios provide a record of your learning to present in applications for future study programs or 
employment.1 
Developing your eportfolio might require you to develop new technical skills in Mahara or WordPress.  For 
information on using Mahara, download this PDF quick-start guide.

[22] 
Identify Learning Goals for Assignments 
You need a clear understanding of what the instructor wants before starting on any assignment of project. Then 
you will want to translate assignment terms and requirements into useful clues as to what your instructor expects. 
When you are not sure, remember to ask the instructor. 
The first step is to read the assignment carefully as soon as you receive it. 
 
Image Credit: Rawia Inaim 
 
Interpreting the Assignment 
Ask yourself a few basic questions as you read and jot down the answers on the assignment sheet: 
• What is the task you need to do in this assignment? 
• Why did your instructor ask you to do this particular task? 
65
• Who is your audience? 
• What kind of evidence do you need to support your ideas? 
• What kind of writing style is acceptable? 
• What kind of referencing style must be used? 
• What guidelines must you follow? 
 
Terms that might be used to determine the task 
• Identification Terms: cite, define, enumerate, give, identify, indicate, list, mention, name, state. 
• Description Terms: describe, discuss, review, summarize, diagram, illustrate, sketch, develop, outline, trace. 
• Relation Terms: analyze, compare, contrast, differentiate, distinguish, relate. 
• Demonstration Terms: demonstrate, explain why, justify, prove, show, support. 
• Evaluation Terms: assess, comment, criticize, evaluate, interpret, propose. 
 
Begin with Background Content 
Most assignment will be related to the materials you have studied in the course up to the point of the assignment. 
As you read the assignment or project requirements, start by identifying which theories, formulas, and graphics 
relate. Consider what research you will need to do to complete the project.

[23] 
Use a Rubric to Evaluate Your Work 
What is a Rubric? 
When you receive many of your course assignments, you may also receive a copy of the rubric the instructor will 
use to grade your work. The rubric provides information on what criteria shape a highly successful assignment. 
 
How to Use Rubrics 
Your assignment instructions and rubric are two of your key tools throughout the process of completing the 
assignment. These provide an outline of the criteria that the instructor has set out for a successful assignment. 
There are two key times to use the rubric and assignment instructions: 
1. Before you start writing: Unfortunately, time may be lost writing something that does not meet the key 
guidelines you must follow. To avoid this problem, take time to read both the assignment instructions 
and rubric carefully before beginning. Clarify any areas of confusion with your instructor. 
2. After you have written a draft, but before you submit the assignment: At this point, grade your work 
according to the rubric. Think carefully and critically. Are there areas where you may not have met the 
criteria well? If so, edit your work accordingly, making the needed revisions before submitting the 
assignment. 
The video below provides additional strategies for using rubrics.  When you are finished the video,  scroll to the 
bottom of the page for a reflective activity. Then, go to the next chapter to move on in the workshop. 
 
One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view them online here:

Making Rubrics Work for You: Video Script 
When you receive an assignment, you may notice that it includes a rubric or checklist that indicates how your 
instructor will mark your work. Have you ever thought that this could be a powerful learning tool for you? 
In this video, you’ll learn how use a rubric to its maximum potential to support your learning. 
The first time you want to look at the rubric is when you first begin working on your assignment. You want 
to avoid making the unfortunate make of putting a lot of time and effort into an assignment, only to miss an 
important element of the assignment requirements. 
Analyze the rubric carefully. What is your instructor looking for? Which sections receive more marks? What 
elements are worth fewer marks?  Use this information to determine how you want to focus your efforts. 
Not sure what a term on the rubric means? Now is a great time to ask! 
67
Now, imagine that you’ve finished writing the first draft of your assignment. How does the rubric help now? As 
it turns out, there are some powerful things you can do with a rubric at this stage in your work. 
One secret to student success is learning to accurately understand how your work meets the expectations of your 
course. One way that you can do this is to put yourself into the place of your instructor, and try to grade your own 
assignment according to the rubric. 
Does your assignment meet expectations? If it doesn’t quite yet, you still have time to consider what changes you 
want to make. 
After you receive the marked assignment from your instructor, compare how your self-evaluation with the 
rubric compares with how your instructor graded your work. Where did you notice differences? 
As you continue to use this process, you will work towards using a rubric to self-evaluate accurately – so that 
your self-evaluation closely matches your instructor’s evaluation of your work. 
So, as you can see, a rubric can be a powerful tool for learning. By using your rubric effectively, you will be able 
to produce work that accurately meets the expectations of your course.  Make the rubrics work for you! 
 
Reflection and Application 
Take out your assignment instructions and rubric. Use them to answer the following questions: 
• Describe in one sentence your task on this assignment: What do you need to do? 
• What resources will you use to complete this assignment? Review any textbook materials, handouts, or class notes that relate 
to this assignment. 
• How many additional resources do you need to find to complete the assignment task? (consider books, peer reviewed 
articles, websites, or other resources). 
• What content do you need to create for this assignment? 
• What guidelines do you need to follow related to the format of the assignment? 
• What format do you need to use for citations and references (APA, MLA, and Chicago are the most commonly used).

Create an Assignment Plan 
Now that you have a clear idea of what you need to do, the next step is to break down the assignment into 
manageable “chunks”. The idea of completing a major research paper may seem overwhelming, but if you can 
divide the task into achievable steps you will be on your way to success. 
Use the chart below to break your assignment into smaller steps. You will want to create steps that can be done 
easily in one day, and preferably in a single work period. Consider the following example breakdown for a research 
paper.

In the above example, the assignment is divided into smaller pieces, with a manageable amount to complete 
each day. It is also clear when each task has been completed.  A daily work goal like “work on research paper” is 
not well-defined, and can seem overwhelming.  This can make it easy to procrastinate.  By choosing specific and 
achievable goals, you may become more motivated to get started, and you will be able to measure your progress 
each day.  Remember to reward yourself for meeting your goals along the way.

Use Feedback to Move Forward 
“We all need people who will give us feedback. That’s how we improve.” – Bill Gates 
During the learning process, we have many opportunities to receive feedback about the quality of our learning 
and work. In the university environment, this often comes in the form of grades and instructor comments on 
assignments and exams. By using this feedback to evaluate your learning strategies in light of your goals, you will 
be able to make adjustments to move you towards your goals in current and future courses. 
 
Consider the Purpose of Feedback 
Many people find feedback difficult to receive, particularly when it indicates areas for improvement. Shifting 
your mindset as you receive feedback can be a catalyst for personal growth. View feedback as a gift that is 
intended to allow personal growth, stronger future academic performance, and professional development. When 
you receive feedback, take time to reflect on the comments given. Direct the feedback towards future assignments; 
rather than considering what you might to differently on the current assignment, use the feedback to inform your 
future goals and work on subsequent projects. 
 
Reflecting Mid-Course 
An excellent time for self-evaluation is after you have received feedback on your first midterm exam or major 
assignment. Consider the following reflection questions at this stage in your course: 
• What grade do I hope to achieve in this course? ________ 
• To what extent am I meeting my goal for the course at this point? 
• What about my exam/assignment preparation worked well? 
• What about my exam/assignment preparation did not work well? What do I want to change? 
• How will what I have learned help me in the second half of the course? 
If you have identified an area for growth that requires change, consider new learning strategies. Consider the 
resources available to you:  online learning, workshops, tutoring, support from classmates, and your instructor. 
Identify the people on your “team” that can help you respond to feedback and move towards your new goals. 
 
Reflecting at the End of a Course 
The completion of a course is also an excellent time for reflection and evaluation. In addition to the questions 
in the midterm evaluation, consider the following: 
1. How will what I have learned help me in my next courses? 
2. How will I use what I have learned in my future career and other aspects of my life? 
By reflecting on feedback and evaluating your learning regularly, you will avoid getting stuck in unproductive 
patterns. You will contribute to your own ongoing personal growth and development, supporting your success in 
future courses and other life endeavours.

the most important material to support your growth, and reading it strategically.  By the end of this module, you 
will be able to: 
• Assess the place of reading in your learning journey. 
• Evaluate your reading skills. 
• Review and apply the SQ3R method for reading. 
• Read journal articles strategically. 
• Take effective notes on online readings.

Assess the Place of Reading in Your Learning Journey

Reading and the Online Learning Journey 
Online learning typically requires you to interact with a larger amount of written material than traditional in-
class courses. This can benefit your growth as a lifelong learner by developing your skills in selecting relevant 
reading material, approaching it purposefully, and managing the information you read. Consider the following 
principles as a guide as you approach reading: 
1. Not all reading material requires equal time or attention. Unlike a novel, where you give most pages 
equal time in order to understand the story, much of your professional reading is focused on finding 
and using relevant information. This means that you may not read every word in available readings. 
Some information may require a close and careful reading, while other information may be skimmed 
to find key points. 
2. Before you begin reading, identify your purpose for reading. What do you need to learn from this 
reading? This will determine how you approach the reading material. 
3. Use questions to guide your reading. In the next sections of this module, you will learn a strategy called 
SQ3R that can guide you through the process of using questions to guide your reading. 
75
4. Develop a system for identifying important information and taking notes. You have already explored 
systems for online information management. Consider how you will mark key learning in the texts that 
you read, and organize this information in a form where you can easily access it again. 
Go to the next chapter to explore reading strategies in more detail.

Now that you’ve thought about your personal reasons for reading textbooks, how can you read them effectively? 
One of the barriers to reading for many students is the time it takes.  So, what strategies can help you read more 
effectively and efficiently? 
First, it’s important to know that you can approach a textbook very differently than a novel. You don’t need to 
read everything right in order. You will also pay more attention to some sections, and less attention to others. 
Here’s a process to guide you in your reading. It’s called the SQ3R strategy. What does that stand for? 
• Survey 
• Question 
• Read 
• Recite 
• Review 
Let’s talk about each step. 
S – Survey. This step allows you to get an overview of the chapter as a whole – what will you learn by reading? 
In this step, you will: 
• Read the Learning Objectives or chapter introduction 
• You will read the chapter summary and the end (you don’t have to wait until you’re finished the chapter 
to read the summary) 
• You’ll skim the study questions at the end of the chapter 
• And you’ll skim the chapter headings, and any important diagrams or charts. 
78
At the end of this step, you should know how this chapter is organized and what you will learn by reading. You 
might find it helpful to end this step by making an outline of the chapter on a separate page. 
Q – The in S3QR stands for question
question. This is a key step in reading for a purpose – you need to know what you 
hope to learn by reading each part of the chapter. Look at the first chapter heading. Now, make up a question that 
you will answer by reading. 
Use who, what, where, when, and why questions. 
R – The first R stands for Read
Read. You will read to answer the questions you just created. This will help you to stay 
focused on your purpose for reading. 
R – The second R stands for Recite
Recite. After reading each section, say the answer out loud. Now, write this down in 
your notes. This step helps you to summarize the material in your own words, which will support your learning 
and remembering. Explaining a concept in your own words demonstrates that you understand it. 
R – The last R stands for Review
Review. Look at your notes from the whole chapter. Think about how different concepts 
fit together, and fill in any gaps. 
Now that you know the steps in the method, it’s time to think more deeply about how this method supports your 
learning. You’ll do that by completing the quiz in the next section of the workshop. The real test will be applying 
the method to your actual reading – try it out, and see how it works for you.

Identify the Purpose of SQ3R Steps 
In the previous section of the workshop, you watched a video or read about a reading method called SQ3R. To 
strengthen your knowledge of what you learned in the video, take the quiz below. To complete the quiz, drag the 
words to the correct places in the paragraph. When you are finished the quiz, move on to the next topic.

Apply the SQ3R Method 
Now that you are familiar with the steps of the SQ3R Method, you may want to apply them to a text you are 
reading this week. To see how the steps are applied to an actual reading activity, watch the video below. At several 
points in the video, you will have the opportunity to pause and try the steps in the method. When you are finished 
the video or reading, go to the next chapter to move on in the workshop.

https://kpu.pressbooks.pub/learningtolearnonline/?p=126#oembed-1 
Apply It 
Commit to trying the SQ3R method once this week as you complete your course readings. As you do, consider the following 
questions: 
1. How does the SQ3R method change how you approach your reading? 
2. How will you adapt and personalize this process to your own learning strengths and the specific requirements of your 
courses? 
Video Transcript 
Now that you have learned the five steps in the SQ3R method, how will you apply them as you read? In this 
video, you will view a demonstration of how this method is applied to the type of reading you might encounter 
in a course textbook. I’ll focus on the first three steps in the method:  surveying the chapter, formulating 
questions, and reading to find key information. Today I’m going to read a chapter in an Organizational 
Behaviour Textbook on need-based theories of motivation – the same principles would apply to reading in other 
courses. My first step is to survey. I’ll skim the chapter quickly to get the main idea. 
The first place I will begin is the Learning Objectives. I notice that in this textbook, they are located at the 
beginning of the chapter. I read these carefully to discover the main concepts that I will learn by reading. The 
next part of the chapter I’ll review is the key takeaways at the end of the chapter.  Remember – there’s no rule that 
says that I need to read each page in order. By reading the key takeaways, I gain a sense of the most important 
information in the chapter. This will help me to focus my reading later. 
Now, I’ll go back to the beginning of the chapter, and briefly skim the contents. I’ll pay particular attention to the 
headings and to any key diagrams. I’m noticing a key diagram for both Maslow’s hierarchy of needs and the ERG 
theory. I also notice two other key headings as I skim: I now know I will read about two factor theory, and acquired 
needs theory. From the information I’ve gained in the survey step, I’ve determined that my goals for reading are: 
81
• To be able to describe the four theories of motivation. 
• To identify how these theories are similar and different. 
• And to understand how each theory explains employee behavior. 
My next step is to begin questioning and reading. I’ll base my questions on key headings I notice. The first heading 
I read is Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. What questions can I ask about this? You may want to pause this video here, 
and try to create 3-4 questions you might want to ask. Then, resume the video to see how the questioning process 
works. 
Here are the questions I’ve developed: 
1. What is Maslow’s hierarchy of needs? 
2. What are the levels in Maslow’s hierarchy? (I remember that there are levels from my survey step) 
3. Why are there different levels in the hierarchy? 
4. How does Maslow’s theory explain employee behavior? 
I’ve added my questions to my notetaking page. I begin reading looking for the answer to my first question. I 
find the answer here, in the first paragraph. The theory is based on a simple premise: Human beings have needs that are 
hierarchically ranked. There are some needs that are basic to all human beings, and in their absence nothing else matters. As 
we satisfy these basic needs, we start looking to satisfy higher order needs. 
Now, I want to add this information to my notes. To get the most benefit of this step, I will recite the information 
in my own words, then write it down. The step of putting information into my own words ensures that I 
understand it clearly. 
I pause and think about how I can express what I’ve read in my own words. I can say it like this: Maslow’s theory 
states that everyone has levels (a hierarchy) of needs. When our basic needs are met, we move to fulfill our higher levels of need.
I’ll now add this information to my notes. 
You will notice that I have left a wide margin on my note-taking page. This space allows me to add additional 
thoughts, images, and questions about the material later on. I may want to add additional information I learn in 
class. 
I’ll move through the same steps to answer my other three questions. You may want to pause this video here, 
and try these steps out for yourself. 
As I’m reading, I will also take note of key terms in bold letters. For example, I see that physiological needs is a key 
term in this chapter. These are words that I want to be able to define, as they are important to my understanding 
of the course material. 
I will work through the chapter, following the same steps for each main chapter section: create questions, read 
to find the answers, recite my answer, and write it in my notes in my own words. 
Now that you have seen how the SQ3R method might be applied to a textbook chapter, try it!  Notice how this 
changes your reading process? How do you want to use this information to read in the future?

Read Journal Articles Strategically 
Throughout your academic career, you will read a variety of journal articles as you complete coursework and 
conduct research for assignments. Journal articles may seem daunting, but by understanding how journal articles 
are organized and written, you will be able to choose relevant articles and find the information you need. 
 
Parts of a Journal Article 
Abstract and 
Keywords 
This is a concise summary of the article. Read this first to decide if the article is relevant to your current research topic. Below the abstract 
you will find 4-5 keywords. These indicate the subject area of the article. 
Literature 
Review 
Most articles will have a literature review early in the paper. This summarizes the past research done on the topic. Note that this is not a 
discussion of the research in the current article. However, the literature review may point you to other material relevant to your project. 
Research 
Methodology 
This section describes the way in which the research was conducted. Who are the participants? Is the study qualitative or quantitative? How 
was the data gathered? Where was the study conducted? 
Results 
This section discusses the findings of the study in detail. It often includes statistical information, charts and graphs. 
Discussion 
In this section, the researchers discuss the significance of the results. What do the results mean? Are they significant? What are the 
implications of what was found? The authors might also indicate areas for further study. 
References 
Skim the reference list. This may lead you to other key articles that are related to your topic. 
How to Approach Journal Articles 
1. Begin by reading the abstract and keywords. Decide if this article relates to your current research project. 
If the article does not fit well with your research, stop reading. 
2. If the article seems relevant, scan the article briefly. Look at the headings, as well as terms in bold and italics. 
Also, look at charts and graphs. 
3. Before you begin reading the article, note the bibliographic information. You will need this for your Works 
Cited or References page. 
4. Now, read the discussion section closely. This is key to understanding the article well. 
5. On a separate sheet of paper, create questions that you will answer by reading the article. Include questions 
such as: “From what you know, does this author agree with other researchers and what you understand 
about the topic? Does this article support or contradict your thesis?” 
6. Read the article purposefully, answering your questions. Do not be afraid to change your questions as you 
read and discover more. 
7. When you find the answers to your questions, write them down, along with the page number where you found 
the information. You will need the page numbers to properly cite your sources when you write. 
As you learn to approach journal articles systematically, you will become skilled at extracting important information as 
you read.

Take Effective Notes on Online Readings 
Why take notes on online content? After all, you can easily search for it and read it again. However, re-reading 
is not always the most effective use of time. Taking good notes helps you to quickly review the key points in the 
material that you have read. 
Taking notes is also an effective learning strategy. Intentionally annotating the texts that you read requires you to 
critically engage with the material. You are doing the work of identifying the important content, and considering 
its implications for your course and your professional practice. This practice facilitates deep learning, and ensures 
that you remember key material. 
Choose the note taking method that is most effective for you. You may prefer traditional notebooks. Many 
readers underline, highlight, and put key notes in the margins of their books.  You may prefer to create typewritten 
notes, and to store these notes in using your electronic notebook/ information management system. Another tool 
for engaging with digital texts is Hypothes.is.  Watch the video below, and consider how this tool might work for 
you. If you prefer reading to watching videos, scroll to the bottom of the page for a transcript. When you are 
finished, go to the next chapter to move on.

Video Transcript 
So, you have your texts for your course – but they’re not regular textbooks. You’ll be using online texts and other 
articles as the primary readings in your course. What strategies can you use for making effective notes that will 
help you retain what you are reading, prepare for exams, and note key information for use in your assignments? 
One tool that can help you take notes electronically is Hypothesis. Hypothesis is a free tool that you add to the 
Chrome browse that allows you to highlight and add notes to online text. In this video, you will learn how to install 
Hypothesis, create notes and highlights, and create a group to work collaboratively with your classmates. 
To get started with Hypothesis, you will first create a free account. Type hypothesis into the search bar to visit 
the page. On the top right, you will find a “Get Started” button. Click here to create your account. You will provide 
your email address, create a user name, and password. Then, check your email and click on the link to activate 
your account. 
The second step is to install the Hypothesis extension in your web browser. In this case, you will use the Chrome 
browser. To install the extension, go to the “Get Started” section of the Hypothesis page. Then, click the Chrome 
extension button. This will guide you through the steps of installing the extension. 
When the extension is installed, you will see a square icon at the top left of your screen. When you click this 
icon, you will see a new menu on the far right of your browser. Click the arrow to open the menu and login. 
85
Next, you will choose where to store your notes. Be aware that the default setting is public. You will likely want 
to create a private group for personal notes or group projects. To create a group, click on Public, and then create a 
new private group. For each text you highlight, you can choose which group can see your notes. This feature can 
be especially helpful for group study and projects. You may also wish to create a group that only you can see to 
store personal notes. 
Now, begin reading and taking notes. Today I’m going to read and take notes on this chapter on procrastination 
from an online text. 
When I highlight some text, I have the option to highlight or annotate the text. When you click on highlight, the 
text is marked with a yellow highlight, as you might expect. This can be helpful in identifying key points in the 
document. However, be careful not to over-highlight – be very selective in highlighting only key information. 
I assumed that procrastination was always a time management problem. What might be a different reason that I 
procrastinate? 
Finally, I can choose to add a page note that summarizes my key learnings or questions, or indicates how I might 
use this information in the future. As I read this page, I found the information on the Pomodoro technique useful. 
If I was reading this text together with a group of classmates, I might add something like this to the notes: 
I found the Pomodoro technique interesting – has anyone else used this method successfully? 
My group members can then respond with their own insights. 
Reading purposefully requires you to actively interact with texts. In this video, you learned how to use 
Hypothesis as a tool for engaging with online texts. You learned how to create an account, install the extension, 
and use the basic highlighting and annotation tools. 
How might you use Hypothesis to support the reading in your courses?

About the Editors 
The editing team is composed of the program director, Dr. Donna Westfall-
Rudd, and two previous teaching assistants for the Graduate Teaching 
Scholars program within the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS) 
at Virginia Tech: Dr. Courtney Vengrin was part of the first cohort of Scholars 
who created the program, and Dr. Jeremy Elliott-Engel conducted the first 
extensive evaluation of the program as part of his assistantship. This 
collective work informed the continued development and improvement of 
the program. 
 
Donna Westfall-Rudd, Ph.D. Planning and teaching formal and nonformal 
educational experiences for adults in agriculture is my passion! While I was 
a high school agriculture teacher in upstate New York I served three years 
as part of a group of teacher leaders who planned and conducted the annual 
professional development programs for agricultural education teachers.  I 
really enjoyed being a part of the planning work and this interest guided my 
decision to leave the high school classroom after seven years, to serve as the 
State Coordinator for Agricultural Education. During my ten years as state 
coordinator I worked with a group of teachers and state staff to design and 
implement a number of professional development programs to address the 
needs of new and experienced agricultural education teachers.  I am very 
thankful that I am able to continue working with program planning as a part 
of my faculty responsibilities in Agricultural, Leadership, and Community 
Education at Virginia Tech.  In 2012 I was appointed the Program Director 
and Senior Faculty Scholar for the new Graduate Teaching Scholars Program 
(GTS).  I’ve worked collaboratively with the GTS students, and their faculty 
mentors to create this very unique three-year program for doctoral students 
from across the departments in CALS.  Acceptance in the program is 
competitive and is designed for graduate students who want to focus on 
developing their teaching skills along with their research knowledge and 
skills. 
About the Editors and Contributors  |  ix
Courtney Vengrin, Ph.D. I serve as the Senior Director of Assessment of the 
International Council for Veterinary Assessment (ICVA). In my role, I conduct 
research on assessment practices, conduct a variety of data analyses, and 
develop data visualizations. I am originally from Southwest Virginia, where 
I earned a B.S. in Biology at Radford University, and then an M.S. in 
Agricultural Extension Education and a Ph.D in Agricultural Leadership and 
Community Education at Virginia Tech.  Following completion of my Ph.D., I 
was a postdoctoral research fellow who specialized in academic assessments 
working under the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Academic Affairs at 
Virginia Tech. Upon completion of my postdoc, I  relocated to Ames, Iowa 
to become the Coordinator of Assessment and Faculty Development at Iowa 
State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine. During my time at Iowa 
State, I worked to reshape the assessment and faculty development services 
offered and created the office of Curricular Assessment and Teaching 
Support services, where I was named Director. I am the 2020 recipient of the 
Frederick Douglass Patterson Diversity and Inclusion Award at Iowa State 
University’s College of Veterinary Medicine and I was recently selected as 
one of the 12 most impactful women on Iowa State’s campus. 
Jeremy Elliott-Engel, Ph.D. As a young person I joined 4-H where I grew 
in my knowledge of agriculture but also became interested in sharing this 
knowledge with my peers and 4-H families. I organized clinics and 
workshops across my project areas. This was my first introduction to non-
formal education. This interest for improving people’s lives through 
knowledge transfer, even as the areas of interest have morphed from the 
topic of animal science to youth development, has been constant across my 
professional Extension education career. I completed a Ph.D. in Agricultural, 
Leadership, and Community Education at Virginia Tech after serving as 
the teaching assistant for Graduate Teaching Scholars. I currently serve as 
Arizona Cooperative Extension Associate Director—4-H Youth Development 
and Associate Extension Specialist in Agricultural Education, Technology, 
and Innovation with The University of Arizona. Originally from Upstate New 
York I earned a B.T. in Agricultural Business Management from S.U.N.Y. 
Cobleskill and M.A.T. from Cornell University. I worked with University of 
Missouri Extension as a 4-H Youth Development Regional Specialist in 
Newton, McDonald, and Barry counties.

on exercises, primarily in the lab room but with a few outdoor field trips. 
While completing my Master of Science in Forestry at Stephen F. Austin 
State University, I taught Dendrology for six semesters. All labs were taught 
outdoors, either on or off-campus. I gained experience leading groups of 
students in an outdoor environment with various distractions and weather 
conditions. As a graduate student at VT, I learned how to adapt my teaching 
style to a medium-sized indoor lab room. Soils Lab is unique in that it 
involves a combination of lab and field activities and projects and requires 
the help of several TAs due to a large number of sections per week. 
Ghadir Asadi, Ph.D. I am an Adjunct Professor at Radford University. I 
received my Ph.D. in Economics from Virginia Tech. During my graduate 
studies, I had the chance to teach multiple courses of different class sizes. 
I had my first experience in teaching large classes in the third semester 
of my teaching journey. Standing in front of 280 eyes, it was the time that 
I realized my engagement techniques were not suitable for a class of 140 
students. I started searching for methods to help me keep my students 
engaged and interested. I found a few tricks involving technology. I am trying 
to summarize parts of my findings here. 
Anne M. Brown, Ph.D. From a young age, I have maintained a passion for the 
sciences and for serving my communities. Uncovering the unknown, making 
connections across topics, and building community continues to keep me 
excited to be a scientist and an educator. I earned a B.S. in Biochemistry 
and Physics at Roanoke College and completed my Ph.D. in Biochemistry at 
Virginia Tech. I am currently an Assistant Professor and Science Informatics 
Consultant at Virginia Tech, where I lead a lab of 40+ undergraduate research 
students. I teach computational biochemistry, research methods, and data 
science while researching computational modeling and drug discovery for 
various diseases. I found a passion for working with undergraduate research

students during graduate school and used it as a springboard for innovating 
and synergizing both my research and teaching missions as I became a 
faculty member. 
Courtney A. Crist, Ph.D. My first exposure to Extension was through my 
mother as she was a master gardener and took classes through Extension. 
It was not until college when I learned more about the scale and scope 
of Extension work and the role of Extension in serving stakeholder needs. 
As an undergraduate and graduate student in food science, I worked with 
Extension faculty and assisted with the development and facilitation of 
Extension activities ranging across curriculum development, publications, 
programming, and training. Through these unique opportunities, I grew an 
appreciation for the role of Extension through extending knowledge and 
thereby changing lives. The power of Extension resonated as we are the 
nonformal educators making an impact in our community, state, industry, 
and nation by bringing technical assistance and knowledge where it can 
improve people’s lives. I am currently an Assistant Extension Professor in the 
Department of Food Science, Nutrition and Health Promotion at Mississippi 
State University. 
Nasim Ebadi, M.S. I graduated from Virginia Tech with a master’s degree 
in Agricultural and Applied Economics. I had the opportunity to join the 
Graduate Teaching Scholarship program at the College of Agriculture and 
Life Science. As part of the program, I had to teach a course of my choice 
at the undergraduate level. As an international student, I was aware that 
engaging students is hard due to potential language and cultural barriers. 
I used the advantages of technology to strengthen my teaching style and 
guard against my potential deficiencies. I planned each session in such a 
way that I use the most relevant technology in action. Moreover, I added 
different sources such as interesting animations, in-class assignments using 
Microsoft Excel, and external links. Using technology helped me to become 
more focused on teaching and less concerned about the possible constraints. 
My students were focused, more engaged, and happier as well. I co-authored 
a chapter to share my successful experience with the readers. 
Javier S. Garcia, Ph.D. As an undergraduate student, I had the opportunity 
to be an undergraduate teaching assistant. I enjoyed working with students, 
especially helping them understand the concepts of animal husbandry and 
developing their hands-on skills with livestock animals. While working on 
xii  |  About the Editors and Contributors
my Ph.D. I was allowed to further develop my teaching skills through the 
Graduate Teaching Scholars program. I became interested in relational 
teaching as a graduate teaching assistant and experiencing it in high school. 
I learned a lot from my instructors and built a foundation for my teaching on 
what I saw displayed before me every weekday. Believing that the classroom 
should be a fun learning environment, developing good instructor-student 
relationships is a key component in achieving that classroom atmosphere. I 
am now a Research Associate with the United States Department of 
Agriculture Research Service, U.S. National Poultry Research Center, in 
Athens, GA. 
Gordon Jones, Ph.D. I came to my understanding of agriculture through 
family, teachers, and supervisors at summer jobs. It struck me that some 
of these mentors had a real knack for communicating clearly, explaining 
complex subjects simply, and connecting the task at hand to the bigger 
picture. As I pursue a career in Extension education, I remember those 
effective mentors, and strive to make my teaching clear, simple, and well-
connected to the wider world. I completed a Ph.D. in Crop and Soil 
Environmental Sciences at Virginia Tech. Now, I am an Assistant Professor of 
Practice for Commercial Agriculture in Jackson and Josephine Counties with 
Oregon State University Extension. 
Qualla 
 Ketchum. I am a citizen of the Cherokee Nation and grew 
up within the Nation’s boundaries in what is also known as northeastern 
Oklahoma. My technical background is in Biological Systems and Agricultural 
Engineering and I am a current Ph.D. student in Virginia Tech’s Engineering 
Education department. My contributed chapter stems from my experiences 
as both an Indigenous student and Indigenous instructor at predominantly 
white research institutions. I hope to be part of institutional and systemic 
change that incorporates Indigenous knowledge and worldviews into STEM 
education. My work is also inspired by my family—both the generations 
before, particularly my parents who fostered a love of life-long learning and 
curiosity, and the generations to come, including my son. 
Rachel Mack. I am a Ph.D. candidate in Virginia Tech’s Department of 
Agricultural, Leadership, and Community Education. My research interests 
include leadership, horticulture, law, and policy. I am always interested in 
learning new ways to be a more effective teacher. I am a recent graduate 
of the Graduate Teaching Scholars Program. I enjoy teaching online and in-

person lecture courses, but one of my most memorable teaching moments 
comes from teaching labs. I once had a lab student who nervously turned 
in a blank quiz response. I returned his paper and asked him to try again. 
Composing himself, he remembered the answer! 
Chris McCullough, Ph.D. While I was destined for a career as a stand-up 
comedian, I found that teaching was more enjoyable than getting produce 
thrown at me. As I have continued to teach, I’ve been learning how much of 
my sarcastic, dry humor to let out in the classroom. I know that humor is 
how I make myself comfortable in situations, but it isn’t always professional. 
I want to create a welcoming classroom, but I also want students to come 
prepared to learn. For better or worse, I’m figuring out how to present myself 
in a professional manner in the classroom that also allows me to be who I am. 
William Moore, Ph.D. In 2010, I was asked to teach a microbiology class as 
a graduate teaching assistant at Fort Hays State University. It was during 
this first year of teaching that I first witnessed a student have a proverbial 
“aha” moment. The art of teaching has been a joy to my soul ever since. 
As a doctoral student at Virginia Tech, I was afforded the opportunity to 
receive formal education in pedagogy as a Graduate Teaching Scholar in the 
College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. The mentorship tendered through 
that program was invaluable in my development as a career faculty member. 
I have certainly had my share of failures and successes as an academic, and 
it is my hope that my contributed chapter will allow new faculty members to 
learn from these experiences and to be empowered to achieve early success 
in academia. I currently serve as an Associate Professor in the Department 
of Biology and Chemistry at Liberty University. 
Emily Ott, Ph.D.  I completed a Ph.D. at Virginia Tech in Crop and Soil 
Environmental Science and had a teaching assistantship for the entire time. 
Graduate students in the department I was in had either a research 
assistantship or a teaching assistantship. Those with a teaching assistantship 
were required to teach 20 hours a week. For about three years I was lead 
TA for Soils Lab, which typically included about five TAs every semester. 
When I first became the lead TA, I started making some changes to the lab 
course, such as rewriting our lab manual and notebooks. For my semester as 
Instructor of Record for Soils Lab, I made a set of grading rubrics for TAs, and 
I did a new final project for students. In my first two years of graduate school, 
I completed the Future Professoriate Certificate. During the last three years 
xiv  |  About the Editors and Contributors
of my graduate program, I was a Graduate Teaching Scholar. I am invested 
in excellent teaching and my students’ success. Along the way, I found some 
things that worked and encountered some frustrations. I hope that our 
chapter combines my and Hannah’s experience with our background and 
learning through the Graduate Teaching Scholars Program to help current 
and future college laboratory instructors. 
Bethany Wolters, Ph.D. I completed my Ph.D. at Virginia Tech in Crop and 
Soil Sciences in the School of Plant and Environmental Sciences. I decided 
that I wanted to teach at a university after being an undergraduate TA 
in the Soils lab at University of Tennessee at Martin. My first year in the 
Graduate Teaching Scholars Program I was a TA in Soil Fertility, an upper-
level lecture course, and noticed that despite the students’ excitement and 
interest in the topic at the beginning of the semester, after a few months 
they were disengaged, overwhelmed, and uninterested in soil fertility. It 
was my goal to create the same hands-on, engaged learning in the Soil 
Fertility lecture course that I saw in the Soils lab. I was inspired by Dr. Mark 
Williams at Virginia Tech who used active learning in his lecture class and 
coined the term “Fun Fridays.” Over the next two years, as a co-instructor 
and an Instructor of Record, I created hands-on learning lessons for every 
Friday of the semester. I also was a co-creator and co-instructor for Applied 
Agronomic Topics in the Mid-Atlantic, a new online graduate course, and 
I tried to find ways to bring similar hands-on and authentic learning to 
an online format. Almost a decade after my first teaching experience, I am 
now the professor teaching Soils lab at UT Martin, with the help of great 
undergraduate TAs, and am excited to share my experiences with them and 
with you. Feel free to “graft” any of my teaching ideas into the tree of your 
teaching practice.

Introduction 
Here you are, either starting your graduate program or having landed your 
first academic job. As a graduate student or early career professor you might 
be expected to teach, either by leading a course for the first time or serving 
as a teaching assistant (TA) giving class lectures or facilitating laboratory 
activities. You may not have had any prior experience in teaching, which can 
result in high anxiety. 
Those holding academic faculty positions within a college or university 
are expected to be active in teaching, discovery, and outreach. Doctoral 
education programs have historically emphasized preparation for research, 
scholarly publications, and outreach. To address this long-standing 
challenge for graduate students, one college’s administrative leadership and 
faculty decided to create a program to better prepare students for their 
assistantship responsibilities and future career interests as college faculty. 
The primary objective of the Graduate Teaching Scholars Program (GTS) in 
the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Virginia Tech is to prepare 
interested doctoral students for a rewarding academic career. The three-
year, cohort-based program was created through participatory pedagogy. 
Students and the faculty director worked collaboratively to establish the 
objectives for each of the six associated courses and determine the 
significant program elements (Elliott-Engel & Westfall-Rudd, 2018). Each 
year the GTS course syllabi are updated based on the program scholars’ 
needs and the current teaching trends in the academy. 
The program scholars contribute to the college as instructors for courses 
in their home departments. Over time three new courses have been 
developed by scholars in partnership with faculty mentors. In addition to the 
standing activities in the program, scholars also serve as representatives on 
the college committee to select the outstanding senior undergraduate, and 
teach courses in the university’s summer program. In the summer of 2020, 
multiple scholars worked with college leaders to assist faculty struggling to 
convert their courses to synchronized or asynchronous modalities. 
This book is created based on the needs of students enrolled in the 
program. As students and faculty searched for affordable teaching resources 
to meet the needs of graduate teaching assistants, they found that it was 
not easy to find one resource that met their many needs. Over time program 
Introduction  |  xvii
alumni and current students realized that they could write the book they 
sought to find. The group is excited about the opportunity to offer this 
textbook as an Open Educational Resource (OER) to allow all graduate 
students free access to the materials. It is exciting to see the twenty authors 
and two coeditors from the current and alumni of the GTS program sharing 
their experience from their graduate teaching and first employment 
opportunities. Each of these chapters comes from the experiences and 
expertise of these talented individuals who are excited to speak directly to 
their peers through their shared experiences and advice. 
Now complete, the book will be used as a foundational resource for the 
GTS classes. The experiences of writing an OER item also generated interest 
in adding OER as an instructional topic to the program curriculum to assist 
scholars in learning about additional forms of scholarship and the use of 
OER in their future teaching plans. Other OER topics will include strategies 
for cocreating OER with undergraduate and graduate students and the 
economic value of using OER as an alternative to traditional course 
textbooks. As a new element of the GTS program, there are plans to develop 
a second volume of this book in two or three years to allow a new group 
of future students and alumni an opportunity to contribute new ideas and 
strategies to our collection. 
Since the authors and editors are all new to writing a textbook, they 
decided that the first step in the planning process was to create personas of 
the anticipated readers. The personas were created by the scholars enrolled 
in the GTS courses in the spring of 2020 and provided the authors with clear 
reminders of the diversity of potential readers of their work. This exercise 
ignited excitement in the group as members realized that the need for this 
material existed well beyond the scope of the one GTS program on one 
university campus.

Soon after embarking on the development of the book, the editors and 
authors experienced the challenges of teaching during the COVID-19 
pandemic. These challenges included juggling changing expectations of 
teaching in different modalities, learning how to offer instruction in online 
formats, and completing the work for this book. In an effort to provide 
author support and encouragement throughout the writing process, the 
editors used multiple engagement strategies. To provide more individualized 
support to a large team of contributors, each of the editors were assigned 
small groups of authors with whom they were expected to communicate to 
encourage progress with the writing work and assist in addressing questions 
regarding content and formatting ideas. The lead editor also provided 
multiple virtual office hours for contributors in the early months of the 
project, to allow individuals space to gather and discuss their ideas with 
others involved in the project. Throughout the project the editing team 
worked to provide communications recognizing the progress being made 
and the goals that needed to be achieved moving forward. The commitment 
and passion of the book editors and contributors is evidenced in the 
completion of thirteen chapters, in spite of the frequent hurdles that 
emerged from the pandemic.

1. Relational Learning: Creating a
“Working Alliance” in the
Classroom
JAVIER S. GARCIA 
Introduction 
The day has finally arrived; it’s the first day of classes. You make your way 
into the classroom, noticing a couple of students were also early and look as 
nervous as you do. As it gets closer to the start of class, more students mill 
into the classroom. You try to converse with some students as you work to 
get comfortable. Finally, it’s time for class to begin. All eyes focus on you as 
you start to speak and introduce yourself as the course instructor. This is 
your first time teaching a course, which can be daunting, especially for new 
faculty/instructors who may not have previous experience teaching. 
Developing social relationships within a classroom can have wide-ranging 
effects on the classroom environment. Rather than establishing the 
classroom as a dynamic based on power, the instructor’s role in the 
classroom is redefined as a trusted guide through relational learning. 
Instructors can form meaningful bonds and create a climate conducive to 
learning when they form working alliances with their students (Meyers, 
2008). Relational learning, also known as a “working alliance,” relies on strong

relationships between educators and their students as well as on 
establishing rapport in the classroom. This classroom harmony is positively 
correlated to students’ attention, attendance, and satisfaction with the 
course professor (Benson et al., 2005). By establishing those relationships, 
students will be able to motivate, engage, and actively participate in their 
learning. This can be critical in preventing or reducing the likelihood of 
academic failure. 
This chapter will discuss… 
•
Why relationships in the classroom are important.
•
What relational learning is.
•
Some strategies to implement or reinforce relational
learning in the classroom.
Relationships in the Classroom 
Developing positive instructor-student relationships in the classroom has 
many far reaching effects on the classroom environment, such as supporting 
students’ adjustment to school, promoting academic performance, and 
fostering students’ resiliency in academic performance. Rather than 
establishing a classroom environment based on power and control, the 
instructor establishes their role in the classroom as a trusted guide (Rimm-
Kaufman and Sandilos, 2011). The instructor and students accomplish the 
learning objectives of the course by working together. As a result of 
developing these trusted relationships students become motivated, engaged, 
2  |  Relational Learning
and will actively participate in their learning. This is crucial in preventing 
and/or reducing the likelihood of academic failure and creating a fun, yet 
educational, environment. 
A working alliance relies heavily on strong relationships between 
instructors and students and establishes a certain rapport or connection in 
the classroom (Roger, 2009). The concept of a working alliance is rooted 
in psychotherapy research and theory, mainly in the psychologist/patient 
aspect. However, this concept can be applied to the college classroom as 
well. An individual (student) seeks change and another individual (instructor) 
serves as the agent of change (Rogers, 2009). In a survey, undergraduates 
were asked to identify characteristics and behaviors inherent in effective 
teaching. It was reported that 42% of the student responses were ranked 
as follows: work ethic and commitment, positive affect, excellent 
communication 
skills, 
classroom 
creativity, 
concern 
for 
students, 
intelligence and knowledge, demeanor toward students, humanistic value, 
high standards for student work, and popularity among students as the top 
qualities of effective teaching. However, when faculty members were given 
the same survey, only 7% of the faculty listed the same qualities in their top 
10 (Buskist et al., 2002). 
Rapport in the classroom has been positively correlated to students’ 
attention, attendance, and satisfaction of the professor and course (Benson 
et al., 2005; Meyers, 2008). In early childhood education, students in math 
classrooms with more positive teacher-student relationships reported an 
increased engagement in mathematical learning and were more willing to 
help their peers learn new concepts (Rimm-Kaufman et al., 2015). Relational 
learning needs to be used in combination with other techniques and 
pedagogy. As a result, it keeps students motivated and engaged in purposeful 
work. 
Keep in mind that relational learning does not mean that the instructor 
should be friends with their students, but rather, the instructor should have 
a respectful and supportive relationship with their students. Do not create 
a persona that you think your students would find enjoyable or likable. 
Be authentic! Your students will respect you more. In the classroom, use 
language that is inclusive and respectful. Be mindful of your students and the 
experiences they might be going through when you see someone struggling 
in your course. Also, you will find that every classroom has its own 
Relational Learning  |  3
personality. What works for one may not work for another one. Modify your 
approach as needed, and don’t be discouraged. Relational learning is about 
the tone you set for the classroom. 
Diversity 
Relational learning fosters a fun learning environment by creating 
a respectful and supportive relationship between the instructor and 
students. This environment can be further developed to include 
diversity and inclusion, but it is up to the instructor to determine 
how to incorporate this. Using inclusive language is an easy way to 
incorporate inclusion in the classroom. Allowing different 
viewpoints on the topic can help everyone feel like they are being 
heard and have a voice in the classroom. Be sure to remind everyone 
to be respectful, especially when they might not agree with 
someone else’s viewpoint. 
The college classroom itself can be diverse. It might be made up 
of students from around the country and sometimes from around 
the world. Many of the students may not know each other and 
normally wouldn’t interact with each other, except that they are 
attending the same college. 
With relational learning, the instructor can create situations 
where these diverse groups of students can work together, 
communicate, and learn from each other (Westfall-Rudd et al., 2019). 
Assigning student groups so that the members are diverse can also 
aid in further exposing students to different ideas and viewpoints. 
4  |  Relational Learning
Teaching Strategies 
Applying relational learning in the classroom does not have to feel like 
required extra work. This forced application of relational learning appears 
unauthentic and has the reverse effect in the classroom. As an instructor, 
one should ask themselves: How would I like to use relational learning in 
their classroom? What is the outcome expected for using relational learning 
in the classroom? How much effort and time will I dedicate to relational 
learning? Don’t be afraid to challenge yourself, but do not overwhelm 
yourself. 
Establishing 
positive 
and 
constructive 
relationships 
that 
foster 
relationship learning is challenging in the large classroom. This will require 
some creativity and patience on your part (Tanner, 2011). The following are 
suggestions to be applied to your classroom to foster relational learning; do 
not limit yourself. As the instructor, you will have a better understanding 
of your classroom and how you would like your classroom to function. I 
challenge you to be creative and step out of your comfort zone to apply 
relational learning in your classrooms. 
The first day of classes is essential in establishing a relationship between 
the instructor and students. It is their first interaction. Just remember that 
each person brings a different personality to the classroom. You must be able 
to easily flow between different students’ personalities as well as upholding 
your own without the use of a persona. This may be difficult, keeping this 
in mind should make it easier to keep these interpersonal relationships 
between student and instructor. On the first day of class, the instructor 
generally gives an overview of the course, goes over the syllabus, and 
perhaps goes into some of the course material. This is important as it sets 
the course’s expectations and gives students an idea of what the course will 
be throughout the semester. However, this possibly is not the ideal setup 
for relational learning. Something as simple as telling your students a little 
bit about yourself on that first day, such as where you came from, your 
educational background, hobbies, pets, and so on, helps your students relate 
to and feel more comfortable with you. 
An example. One semester, I co-taught at a land-grant university in 
Virginia. The class was Introduction to Animal Science 1464. I introduced 
myself and made myself relatable with them by explaining that I was once in 
their position: I was a student in the same classroom, possibly sitting in the 
Relational Learning  |  5
same seats. I then transitioned into where I was from; most of the students 
were in-state, so the likelihood of meeting a student from the area I was from 
was highly probable. I recall that one of the students that I was teaching that 
semester happened to be from my hometown and had gone to the same high 
school as me. This student would often come to me for questions, help with 
assignments, or just friendly conversation. The takeaway here? The more 
relatable I was to them, the easier it was for the students to come to me 
with questions and concerns with that class. The familiarity often put them 
at ease, and they were willing to reach out to the instructor. 
Having students complete a simple survey about themselves before the 
first day of classes serves as a fun speaking topic during the course’s first 
day. Questions such as Are you in-state or out-of-state? Where are you 
from? What year are you? Future career goals? Why are you taking this 
course? What are you hoping to learn from the course? The survey results 
will then give you, the instructor, a better idea of the class characteristics. 
In addition, because you asked about the students’ perceptions of the class 
and their learning objectives, you are better positioned to know the students’ 
expectations about the course. During the first day of the course, the results 
could be presented in a simple graph or table to give students a better idea 
about their peers. The instructor may use the results as a prompt for class 
discussion or as a question-and-answer segment to answer any questions 
about the course. This exercise aims to get a better understanding of the 
students in the course and helps develop an open learning environment in 
which students will feel a sense of connectedness toward their instructor. 
A syllabus is also an essential tool in establishing a relationship between 
the instructor and their students. It provides students with information 
about the course they are enrolled in. It provides them with important 
dates and deadlines, the instructor’s contact information, and comprises 
an agreement between the instructor and the students. Nothing sours a 
relationship faster than a syllabus that is not followed by either the 
instructor or the student(s). Ensure the office hours detailed in your syllabus 
are set times when you will be available in your office. Try your best to stay 
within your set date and deadlines. Unpredictable circumstances can occur 
from time to time, but make sure to communicate with your students if any 
changes arise. 
6  |  Relational Learning
Syllabus Development 
The syllabus plays a vital role in relational learning as it lays out 
the students’ expectations for the course. As an instructor plans 
their syllabus, they should be as clear as possible about their 
intentions for the course. The syllabus establishes the rules of the 
course and should be used as a reference by students. Typically, a 
syllabus contains the instructor’s contact information, required 
materials for the course, a tentative schedule for the course, and a 
list of resources available to students. This gives students an idea of 
what to expect from the course and the instructor. The language 
used in the syllabus can set the tone of the course, so in the 
syllabus, use language that is deliberate and gets the point across 
but is not punitive. Students should feel like they can contact the 
instructor if they have questions and not fear being scolded. 
Learning your students’ names helps develop positive relationships between 
the instructor and students (Tanner, 2011). Although it is a simple concept, 
learning a student’s name makes the students feel a personal connection 
with their instructor, which is beneficial in developing your classroom’s 
learning environment. This is a bit more challenging in larger classrooms 
but can be accomplished with some practice. Having students bring in a 
large index card with their name or make a name tent (a piece of paper 
folded in half with the name written on one side that is perched in front 
of the student) is the simplest way to learn your students’ names (Tanner, 
2013). Whenever a student has a question, they will raise their hand, and 
before you call on them to answer the question, look at the name on the 
name tent. Another simple way to learn students’ names is to ask them to 
say their names before asking their questions. In smaller classes, you can 
require each student to come to your office during office hours the first 
Relational Learning  |  7
week of classes for a quick 5- to 10-minute meeting to get to know them. 
As the semester progresses, repeating this strategy sporadically as students 
complete exams and projects will allow you to engage in discussions focused 
on student progress in the course. You will also receive feedback on the 
different aspects of the course. Over time, these strategies will help you 
learn and remember your students’ names as well as build instructor-
student relationships. 
Another simple strategy to foster positive instructor-student relationships 
is for the instructor to come to class early. This flexibility in the instructor’s 
schedule opens classroom availability and classroom visibility. Being present 
15-20 minutes before the start of the class gives the instructor some time to 
interact and converse with students or answer questions students may have. 
These interactions or conversations could focus on the course material, but 
generally, the interactions or conversations can focus on topics outside the 
classroom, especially as the semester progresses and students become more 
comfortable with the instructor. The instructor’s facial and body languages 
are also crucial in students feeling comfortable approaching the instructor, 
so remember to make yourself approachable. Students can read a room. If 
your presence is aloof and off-putting, you may turn your students away 
because of your demeanor. On the other hand, being easygoing and fluid 
with your classroom style will make it feel more relaxed and comfortable to 
the students. 
Teaching assistants (undergraduate and graduate), if available to the 
instructor, play an important role in relational learning. A former teaching 
mentor described graduate and undergraduate teaching assistants (TAs) as 
ambassadors to the classroom. Undergraduate TAs are generally within the 
same age range as the students in your classroom and are peers to your 
students. In some cases, graduate TAs might be the only instructor students 
interact with. It is important to have them involved in implementing 
relational learning in the classroom. This will further reinforce the 
environment you are trying to create in the classroom. Teaching assistants 
can be a great resource that may pick up on issues you may not be aware of. 
The strategies described in this chapter can be applied to classrooms of 
any size. Relational learning can be modified to fit the instructor’s needs and 
the resources available. Establishing the foundation for relational learning 
at the beginning of the semester is essential to maintaining that learning 
environment throughout the semester; once that foundation has been set, it 
is easy to keep it going. Do not be discouraged if a strategy for incorporating 
8  |  Relational Learning
relational learning in the classroom does not work or does not have the 
desired outcome. It requires some trial and error, along with patience. When 
relational learning is effectively applied in the classroom, the results are 
a lot of fun. The learning environment is very enjoyable not only for the 
students but also for the instructor. Students invest more in the course, 
playing a larger role in their learning and collaborating with the instructor to 
achieve their course goals. Relational learning is beneficial for the learning 
environment for your classroom and the students, as they become more 
active in their own education as they progress through college.

Graduate teaching assistants (GTA) are the students who are (1) currently 
enrolled in a graduate school program and (2) assisting faculty or instructors 
in colleges, universities, and professional schools on teaching or teaching-
related tasks. GTAs take on significant responsibilities in undergraduate 
instruction at large research universities (Gardner & Jones, 2011). These 
responsibilities might include teaching introductory undergraduate level 
courses, helping with curriculum development, proctoring exams, assisting 
students in science labs or during office hours, and grading assignments. 
According to the U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Employment 
Statistics, there were 131,120 GTAs employed in colleges, universities, and 
professional schools in May 2016. 
International graduate teaching assistants (IGTAs) are GTAs who are 
neither U.S. citizens nor permanent residents. Instead, IGTAs are temporary 
visa holders. With the sharp increase of international students attending 
graduate schools in the United States (Figure 1.1), IGTAs play a considerable 
role in undergraduate education across many disciplines, including 
agricultural fields (Table 1.1). The diversified perspectives that international 
students bring into graduate programs in the United States are essential 
to both maintaining America’s leading role in technological innovation and

preparing the graduates from undergraduate agricultural programs to be 
competitive in the international workforce. With the increasing global nature 
of the food and agriculture industry, “diversity skills,” including the ability 
to work in diverse communities, the possession of multicultural awareness, 
and the ability to interact with people of different backgrounds, have been 
identified by faculty in the agriculture field as valuable skills (Blickenstaff, 
Wolf, Falk, & Foltz, 2015). These were also highlighted as Research Priority 
Areas by the American Association for Agricultural Education as necessary 
for agricultural graduates to prepare “a diverse workforce that includes 
scientists and professionals with knowledge and skills beyond today’s 
standards” (Doerfert, 2011).  It is essential to acknowledge and utilize the 
global perspectives that international students bring to American 
institutions.

While IGTAs play an essential role in undergraduate education in the United 
States (Gorsuch, 2011), IGTAs also face many challenges, including difficulties 
with oral English proficiency, especially communicative competence—that 
is, understanding students’ questions and responses. Although IGTAs obtain 
relatively high scores in standardized English proficiency tests, they still 
encounter problems interacting with undergraduate students in various 
instructional settings. This has been a big challenge, often resulting in 
misunderstandings between IGTAs and students (Andrea, 1995). Emotional 
factors, such as the anxiety and stress related to public speaking, and their 
confidence when communicating with students, influence their pragmatic 
competence (the ability to use the language appropriately considering the 
social context) (Aslan, 2016). Current support, which often solely focuses 
on language proficiency (Fox & Gay, 1994), inadequately prepares IGTAs for 
their duties. A shift needs to be made to a more comprehensive training 
model, which includes understanding academic culture in the United States, 
the application of English in classroom communication, and interaction with 
students in various instructional conditions, both in- and outside of the 
classroom. 
Besides the difficulties in spoken language, cultural barriers also lead to 
the poor performance often exhibited by IGTAs, which is reflected in the 
negative evaluations they receive from the undergraduate students in their 
classes. IGTAs may face additional stress and anxiety from coping with the 
difference between the culture of their home country and the United States 
(Ross & Krider, 1992). This anxiety can prompt IGTAs to be less willing 
to communicate with their undergraduate students and teaching mentors, 
interactions for which English would be the primary language of 
communication (Roach & Olaniran, 2001). This break in communication may 
Vignette: International GTAs  |  13
be negatively interpreted as unwillingness to engage, or a distrust/dislike 
of students, leading to an inactive and non-engaged learning environment 
(Nakane, 2007). Also, failure to acknowledge and follow U.S. cultural norms, 
especially in instructional settings, may result in miscommunication and lack 
of interaction between IGTAs and undergraduate students. 
Training programs for IGTAs need to be developed and enhanced so that 
IGTAs can better cultivate and strengthen the global leadership skills of 
undergraduate students with expertise in food and agriculture. Although 
there are existing on-campus programs and resources to facilitate GTA 
teaching, there is a need for these programs and resources to be tailored to 
fit the need for IGTAs. Below are some ideas: 
1. Provide opportunities for IGTAs to understand the academic cultures in 
the United States.Coordinators can recruit current IGTAs, 
undergraduate students, GTAs, and faculty who work with IGTAs to 
build an IGTA Representative Group to identify the differences of 
academic cultures between the IGTAs’ home countries and the United 
States. Collaborators for this effort can include the graduate school, the 
center for international student services, the teaching and learning 
center, and the office of student affairs. Findings from the IGTA 
Representative Group should be recorded and shared with future 
IGTAs. Understanding and reflecting upon the similarities and 
differences between academic cultures is vital for IGTAs to set 
appropriate expectations for their undergraduate students. 
2. Provide training for IGTAs on communication skills in various 
instructional conditions both in and outside of the classroom.Training 
workshops or courses should be developed to facilitate IGTAs’ English 
communication, such as public speaking skills in formal teaching. The 
training sessions offer peer learning practices for IGTAs to improve the 
communication effectiveness among IGTAs, undergraduate students, 
and faculty mentors in academic settings should be formed. 
Participants learn with and from each other, contributing as equally 
valuable members of the cohort (Boud, Cohen, & Sampson, 2014). These 
practices create a safe environment to practice both speaking and 
listening. Real connections are made among the participants, which will 
encourage the participants to communicate with one another. 
14  |  Vignette: International GTAs
IGTAs will be paired with native GTAs. The pairs will meet before the class 
observation to review the lesson plan and discuss specifics on the aspects 
of teaching that IGTAs aspire to improve. After the peer observation, the 
pairs will discuss teaching techniques and classroom management. Teaching 
experience and strategies will be shared, and misunderstandings relating to 
U.S. academic culture will be clarified. By continuing this practice, IGTAs will 
gain a better understanding of U.S. academic culture. They will be better 
able to communicate with undergraduate students, leading to an overall 
improvement of instructional quality. Native GTAs will also gain knowledge 
of and insight into cross-cultural communication, observation and feedback 
processes, and peer-coaching strategies. 
The IGTAs’ better understanding of U.S. academic cultures and improved 
communication skills will help IGTAs’ succeed in teaching; in turn, 
undergraduate students will benefit from enhanced instruction. The 
improved instruction from IGTA’s can encourage undergraduate students 
to embody global the proper mindset to work with others from diverse 
backgrounds, especially culturally diverse backgrounds (Council, 2009; 
Suárez-Orozco, 2005; Ziguras & Law, 2006).

2. Authenticity
CHRIS MCCULLOUGH 
Introduction 
It is finally time. You are given your first teaching assignment as a graduate 
student, or it is time to teach as part of your first job. Sure, you sat through 
an institutionally required training that seemed to be more about the 
institution not wanting to get sued than giving you ideas about teaching. You 
may feel unsure about what to do teaching, or even if you want to teach at 
all. What and how you teach might be laid out for you already, but you still 
have the power to decide how to present yourself as an instructor. 
You may have encountered a few different instructor personalities during 
your time as an undergraduate. There is the instructor who struggles to 
make the content relatable because everyone should get it. There is the TA 
who is learning the material one week ahead of you because it was the class 
they were told to teach. You may have had the instructor like the one Robin 
Williams played in Dead Poets Society, who wants to inspire you to greater 
things. Another person you possibly have encountered is the uninspiring 
instructor who clearly doesn’t want to be there and whose only goal is to 
get you out the door at the end of class. Finally, you may have had the 
new instructor who is nervously going through their first experience with 
the class; but at least they were very personable. An instructor earns many 
personas. It is important to establish the type of persona you want to adopt 
as an instructor at the outset. Putting some thought into who you want to 
be as an instructor can help guide your lesson plans to better suit who you

When I taught my first class as the instructor of record, I knew I should 
not lean into my personality to the fullest extent possible. I know that being 
funny (I am downright hilarious) is an important part of my identity. It is 
something I cannot escape, and I choose to embrace. In one of the most 
serious moments of my life, I was trying to be funny. I was in a car accident 
about ten years ago. After the emergency personnel cut the car door off with 
the jaws-of-life, they were about to cut my seat belt. I stopped them and 
unbuckled myself, and said, “Don’t worry, I got this.” Later, it was reported, 
the first responders could only laugh. In more personal settings, humor is 
a preference. Using humor in a professional setting is a challenge as the 
consequences for bad attempts are more severe. However, humor has its 
benefits in the classroom, such as reducing anxiety, lightening the mood, 
and occasionally being thought-provoking (Chiarell, 2010). I try to use this 
20  |  Authenticity
core part of my identity to my advantage when possible; however, I know it 
cannot run rampant. Using lots of sarcasm with students, for example, can 
hurt the instructor’s credibility (Banfield et al., 2006). 
Two concepts central to this chapter are teacher identity and authenticity, 
each of which can fill up a textbook on their own. Within identity, there 
are two aspects of interest, our identity as instructors and the identity 
we assume when teaching. That is to say, how do we see ourselves as 
instructors, and what role does that play in our jobs? These aspects of 
identity are fluid, changing in response to the environment, and changing 
over time as we grow (Shelton, 2018). 
Within academia, instructors are commonly split between the professional 
identities of researcher and instructor (Kreber, 2010). Do you see yourself 
as a researcher forced to teach, gaining little fulfillment from teaching? Or, 
do you enjoy teaching but feel like research, and administrative tasks are 
viewed as more important? Instructors draw on cues from different levels of 
the institution to help form a teaching identity. High-level cues come from 
the institution, the broader culture around education, research-teaching 
interface, and effort expected (Fanghanel, 2007). Many of these cues are out 
of an instructors’ control but serve to emphasize the value of teaching at 
the institution. Interpreting the signals of the larger institutional forces is 
important for understanding what is expected of you as an instructor. 
Instructors can draw cues from three levels, high, mid, and personal, to 
get a better sense of what teaching is like at an institution (Fanghanel, 
2007). Most high-level cues are out of an instructor’s control, and may offer 
contradictory signals. The institution may say it values teaching but offer 
little support and recognition for teaching effectively. There are mid-level 
cues to draw from within your discipline and or department (Fanghanel, 
2007). Within this level, instructors can seek community with others in 
the department that teach similar discipline topics. New graduate student 
instructors at Virginia Tech can join the Academy for Graduate Teaching 
Assistant Excellence to learn from other graduate students at the university 
about their experiences teaching as a graduate student. In addition to 
community, instructors may also experience the strongest administrative 
forces that set job expectations (Kreber, 2010). Finally, at the personal-level, 
one’s beliefs about teaching inform our identity (Fanghanel, 2007). These 
would include our previous experiences as an instructor and student, our 
assumptions about students, and what we believe is effective. What is the 
goal of our teaching? Do we want to convey information or teach skills and 
Authenticity  |  21
ideas that are beneficial outside of the classroom? While instructors teach 
content specific to their discipline, many see it as their duty to teach other 
skills like critical thinking or writing (Kreber, 2010). It is also at this level that 
the personal identity that we teach is formed. 
The first time I was a TA, I taught an introductory insect identification 
lab. This lab had a reputation for being relatively easy, and most students 
took the class to meet general education requirements. It was a class many 
students knew was taught by a graduate student. This class was also an easy 
assignment for the TA, as the course content and schedule were already laid 
out. Any changes made were at the TA’s discretion, but we could not alter 
the course content; for example, we couldn’t change which arthropod was 
taught. TAs were not allowed to change the insects on quizzes, but a TA on 
Thursday could change the order of the questions on quizzes from earlier in 
the week to keep students accountable. I liked to spice up lectures with any 
fun or interesting media or information that I could find. For example, did 
you know the shiny green flies in the family Calliphoridae that bother you 
when enjoying a picnic are also the ones that provide the larvae used to clean 
wounds with maggot therapy? It felt more like acting than teaching. I enjoyed 
the experience, but the lack of ownership always reminded me that I was 
a graduate student teaching predetermined content. It felt like the student 
reviews were more about who you were rather than what they learned. 
Teaching Authentically 
A related concept that pairs with identity is authenticity. Instructor 
authenticity has emerged as an area of study; the question is, how does 
instructor authenticity affect interactions with students? Authenticity is a 
nebulous term that is difficult to define in a scholarly sense, and there are 
many scholarly definitions of what authenticity is. In a review of the different 
definitions used, a common theme was being as open as possible about your 
values, beliefs, and biases (Kreber et al., 2007). Other aspects of many of 
these definitions relate to showing passion for the course subject, genuinely 
expressing yourself, and engaging students with topics that matter (Taylor, 
1991). In the context of teaching, authenticity is also associated with being 
kind and sincere with students—it is possible to be an authentically evil 
22  |  Authenticity
person (Chickering et al., 2006). Considering authenticity along more 
practical lines means reflecting your values and passion and making an 
earnest effort to know your students (Kreber et al., 2007). As an instructor, 
there are many ways to reflect your authentic self through the things that 
you do in the course. 
One way to reflect on yourself is through the assessments that you use. In 
a class I taught about how ecological principles are applied in agriculture, we 
frequently discussed what we believed are the best options for agriculture. 
The majority of students in the course were not in a field related to ecology 
nor agriculture. However, everyone engages with agriculture on some level, 
namely choosing what to eat. As part of an assignment on biodiversity, 
students chose a diet scenario from a paper that they read, then they had 
to explain why it is the best choice. Each diet has an environmental cost 
to the production practices that the students had to explain, but they also 
had to convince their peers why this was the best choice. For me, it was 
fun to hear about the reasons why students chose the diets they did and to 
follow-up by asking if their actual diets are reflective of this choice. There 
were a few vegans who lived out their proposed diet, but most of them 
acknowledged they did not follow their own proposed diet. This was mostly 
due to convenience and time. This assessment allowed me to talk to students 
about a question with no correct answer and provided an opportunity to 
understand better the values and judgments students make around food. 
Lessons that let the students do most of the talking can hide some 
potentially difficult aspects of your authentic self as well. I categorize myself 
as more of an introvert than an extrovert. That is not to say that I am fearful 
of public speaking or being in front of the class. Rather, talking for extended 
periods is mentally exhausting for me. One of my least proud moments is 
when I lectured for nearly an hour straight about plant diseases. However, 
there are times when a lecture is necessary, such as when laying out the 
organization and relationships of a new topic. 
By creating lesson plans and assessments that have the students take the 
lead, I can reduce the amount of time that I am at the center. However, there 
are still classes where I lecture. In these classes, I follow a TV schedule. I talk 
for 8–12 minutes, then ask the students a short discussion question. In total, 
I try to limit myself to three of these talking periods. That leaves time in the 
end for some form of assessment as well. This format allows the students to 
interact with material and provides me a break from talking. 
Authenticity  |  23
Diversity 
Being authentic with the students can help build trust with them. 
Share your experiences with the students, maybe they have not 
previously encountered a perspective such as yours. And, by 
offering your own experiences you give permission for your 
students to bring their whole self into the learning environment 
(Elliott-Engel, Amaral, Westfall-Rudd, & Rudd, 2020). The authentic 
sharing of experience builds trust. By building trust with students, 
you can help them feel like a part of a classroom community, a place 
that they would feel comfortable sharing their identities and their 
lived experiences. 
Benefits of Authenticity 
Thinking about who you are can help inform your approach to designing 
your course to maximize your strengths—design assessments and lesson 
plans that do not require you to be the leader. For one assessment, I had 
students make infographics to summarize the unit we just covered. I printed 
out everyone’s infographic, with their names removed, of course, and taped 
them to blackboards in the room. Everyone had an opportunity to write 
comments next to the infographics before we discussed all of them. I was 
still able to gauge the students’ understanding of the material but to do so 
in a way that did not require lots of talking from me. Another activity that 
I enjoy using is having students lead a discussion on a paper reinforcing an 
important concept from the unit. While I still participate, it gives me a break 
from being the leader and lets me be an observer. 
24  |  Authenticity
What if this is your first-time teaching, or you simply want to get through 
your teaching assignment to get on with your research? Are there some 
characteristics that you can utilize to get a start and avoid getting negative 
student reviews? Student evaluations of instructor quality are often tied to 
the different personality traits displayed by instructors (Kim & MacCann, 
2018). Students have their own definition of what it means to be authentic 
and which traits they associated with being authentic. Students use five 
broad traits to evaluate the authenticity of an instructor: approachable, 
passionate, attentive, capable, and knowledgeable (Table 1) (De Bruyckere 
& Kirschner, 2016; Johnson & LaBelle, 2017). By being organized, providing 
timely feedback, and clearly relating course concepts, you can fulfill some 
of the indicators used by students to assess authenticity for being attentive, 
capable, and knowledgeable (Johnson & LaBelle, 2017). To be thought of as 
approachable and passionate, students are looking for excitement, for you 
to share personal stories, and to talk to them outside of class (Johnson & 
LaBelle, 2017). Having enthusiasm for what you are doing is another common 
trait described by students as beneficial for instructor authenticity (Keller et 
al., 2018). 
The behaviors that make an instructor seem inauthentic are the opposite 
of the aforementioned traits: not sharing personal stories or details, not 
getting to know the students, being bored by the content, being slow to 
provide feedback, being disorganized, and being unsure of the material being 
taught (Johnson & LaBelle, 2017). Sometimes, it may seem difficult to avoid 
these negative behaviors; but, by trying to play to your strengths, you can 
still be authentic.

Authoritarian 
I was a TA for two sections of a lab for a class called woody landscape plants. 
The lab was essentially walking around campus and teaching students how 
to identify the plants they learned about in the lecture portion. This was 
one of those class experiences where the TA is only a week ahead of the 
students learning the course material. I know insects, not plants. I took a 
risk with the students and let them know I was learning the material a week 
ahead, rather than hide behind an authoritarian streak and tell them what 
everything was with no room for questions. For graduate student TAs, this 
can be a strategy when forced to teach a class outside of your expertise. 
Being honest rather than authoritarian maintains your credibility with the 
students (Pytlak & Houser, 2014). I also used the students as a resource by 
having them demonstrate how they remembered the characteristics of the 
different plant species. 
The nature of this lab gave me the chance to talk more informally with 
the students. We would trek across campus for the lab looking at plants, 
providing ample time to talk with students. Getting out of the classroom did 
not require me to be a talk show host. I often asked about the lecture portion 
of the class. Or, after spring break, we all shared photos of plants that we 
recognized from class. Once it warmed up enough for insects to become 
active, I could tie some of my passion into the course content that I was 
less familiar with. I was always ready to seize the moment and the insect 
when the opportunity presented itself to bring insects into the discussion. 
There were some natural opportunities to use insects to enhance the class 
experience by providing more details about some specific interactions 
between plants and insects. I pointed out the little balls of fluff on hemlock 
trees that are the invasive hemlock woolly adelgid. There I was, describing 
the unique pollination relationship between yucca moths and the yucca 
plant. The most engaging opportunity was giving everyone a leaf from a 
boxwood plant and having them split it open to see the boxwood leafminer’s 
larvae on the inside. The students in the class seemed to enjoy these little 
asides, as it brought the course content back to an area that I am passionate 
about. 
Authenticity  |  27
Challenges of Authenticity 
Not all graduate TAs may feel the pressure of getting good student reviews. 
But there may be some who feel pressure to perform for the students to 
get a good review. Leaning into some of the attributes that students are 
using to gauge your authenticity can help, but be warned that faking those 
attributes can have negative consequences—constantly putting up a façade 
of enthusiasm when teaching class often results in personal dissatisfaction 
with job performance and emotional distress (Taxer & Frenzel, 2018). 
Furthermore, if you are bad at acting, people will be able to tell that you 
are acting differently than you really feel (Grandey & Gabriel, 2015). It might 
be tolerable to push through a semester of acting to benefit a class as a 
graduate student with little to no training in teaching. Just know, if you are 
acting for positive student reviews, you can get those reviews from students 
at the potential expense of what the students will achieve in your class (Kim 
& MacCann, 2016). If you are new to teaching and it is a big part of your job, 
you may want to take a moment to reflect on who you are as an instructor. 
One other challenge that comes to mind with trying to be authentic when 
teaching is what to do with an online course. With more limited means of 
interacting face-to-face and providing nonverbal cues, expressing who you 
are can be challenging. I have not taught an online course, nor was I one of 
the many instructors who had to transition rapidly to an online course due 
to COVID-19. However, I have had some experiences with online courses as a 
student. These experiences have taught me one lesson for when I inevitably 
have to teach online: put yourself on the screen. The courses I have taken 
have largely been presentations that were narrated by the instructor. I had 
no idea who the instructors were. I think it is necessary to hold virtual 
office hours and recitation sessions to allow the students to talk to me to 
get to know me. Even if you are not comfortable in front of the camera, 
try to express who you are on the syllabus. Be specific about the reasoning 
and rationale behind the policies you have. What does it mean to share 
personal details about yourself in an online class? Another tactic could be 
sharing social media information with the students, but that may blur the 
line too much between professional and personal. While you are allowed to 
share personal views on topics, it can be difficult to disentangle those views 
because you are an instructor at an institution of higher education. There 
may also be deeply personal or slightly embarrassing content that students 
28  |  Authenticity
may not need to know. To choose to share that information with students 
is your choice. Just be prepared for anything you post potentially come up 
in class. Being able to express yourself through technology is something 
that instructors continue to grapple with as more learning occurs online 
(Shelton, 2018). 
Syllabus Development 
One of the first places students will encounter who you are is on 
the syllabus. Be explicit in explaining your rationale for course 
policies to let students see more of who you are. Instead of a late 
assignment policy that says you lose a certain amount of points per 
day late, say you understand that life happens. You are willing to 
work with a student about what is appropriate, provided they 
communicate with you. Provide them with a snippet of reasoning 
about why you have the assessments you do. Let them know the 
course is about developing them as people, not just students to fill 
with information. Infographics assignments succinctly summarize 
the important aspects of a unit; debates are important for picking a 
position and defending the topic. 
Conclusions 
When trying to teach as your authentic self, it is important to take time to 
reflect on who you want to be as an instructor. Developing who we are as 
instructors is a fluid process that takes time (van Lankveld et al., 2017). Taking 
the time to reflect on teaching, especially with the support of institutional 
resources, helps instructors solidify their teaching identity and makes them 
Authenticity  |  29
more likely to adopt student-centered teaching practices (Nevgi & Löfström, 
2015). I consider myself a bit lucky to have had varied teaching experiences 
and be part of programs during my time as a graduate student to allow me 
to reflect on who I want to be as an instructor. With every class we teach, 
we gain new experiences that we can shape ourselves. For example, I had a 
student who was putting in the bare minimum to get by. Then suddenly, he 
was gone for a month. He emailed saying a relative had passed away. I was 
skeptical of that being the case, because he had not done much to earn my 
trust. Shortly after his return to class, I got a note from the student services 
office confirming the details of the student’s experience. While I never said 
anything to the student, I had made some bad remarks to fellow TAs. After 
that experience, I realized I had little choice but to trust students. At best, 
I get a three-hour window into their lives every week during the semester. 
The rest of the time, they are dealing with life. 
You need to think about who you are as an instructor and how you will 
express that before, during, and after teaching your course. Before you begin 
teaching a course, think about how you are going to approach it. Are you 
going to sequester your identity in an air of professionalism and neutrality? 
Will you approach a topic from an intersection of your own identities? When 
you are teaching, moments may arise when you need to set aside or redefine 
your authentic self. If you have students debate a topic, do you try to remain 
impartial or show a bit of bias toward the ideas you like? After the course is 
over and you have read the student evaluations, ask yourself if the comments 
reflect you or the course content? It may feel nice to read positive reviews of 
who you are; but, if the class average was a “C,” what is that saying about how 
well you taught? Was your authenticity being perceived as being nice, or did 
you engage the class with it? 
This is the beginning of your teaching journey; do not expect it to fall 
perfectly into place right away. This is a process that will take time. Before 
you start thinking about what your teaching persona will be and what your 
goals are for teaching, talk with other instructors at the institution to learn 
from their experiences and about what motivates them to teach. Also, seek 
out other resources that the institution may have to help with teaching. 
At Virginia Tech, there is the Academy for Graduate Teaching Assistant 
Excellence. This is a group of graduate students who are willing to share 
their experiences with all aspects of teaching in formal and informal settings. 
Finally, take time to reflect on the course and your teaching once it has 
passed. 
30  |  Authenticity
Reflection Questions 
• 
What are your motivations for teaching this class? Is the 
topic an area of passion for you, or is this simply part of your 
job duties? 
• 
What identities do you possess that could be prominently 
featured while teaching? Are there lessons that could be 
designed that allow you to utilize these? 
• 
Are there resources at the institution such as professional 
development opportunities, teaching groups, or mentors to 
help you develop your teaching practice?

DIDIER MENA-AGUILAR 
On December 2019, I finished my first college-level teaching opportunity, 
acting as a co-instructor responsible of leading half of the lessons in in-
person biochemistry concepts course for more than 270 students. Based 
on the grades and student feedback, I felt satisfied with my performance. 
Student’s comments highlighted two main aspects of my teaching: They 
valued my genuine care for students and the highly structured and organized 
way I taught the course. However, I was well aware of the advantages I 
had in having a more experienced faculty member assisting throughout the 
experience; the older professor was the face of the teaching team, and he 
led most of the logistics and overall planning of the course. I knew that I was 
going to be the sole instructor of the same course in the fall, and I needed 
to take my teaching to the next level in a manner that would benefit my 
students’ learning. 
It is not uncommon for graduate students to feel overwhelmed at the 
prospect of teaching a whole class on their own. I asked myself questions 
about my preparedness and future performance on the course. Will the

teaching courses? I knew I had time to prepare, and I comforted myself with 
my good performance last semester. 
However, in early 2020, the world seemed to stop due to the COVID-19 
pandemic. Airports shut down, businesses closed their doors, and quarantine 
orders were imposed throughout the world. Universities were not exempt, 
and quick actions were taken to transfer in-person courses to fully online. 
I felt lucky that I did not have to teach during spring 2020, and I assumed 
the pandemic was going to end quickly, so I did not have to worry about it 
affecting my future teaching. 
However, summer came, and the pandemic was still going strong. Cases 
were increasing in our little town in the middle of rural Virginia, and it was 
clear that the fall semester was going to be mainly online. For a course 
that was expected to have more than 270 undergraduate students, the only 
possibility was to move the course to a fully online modality. Now the 
challenge was not only to teach a course on my own for the first time, but 
also to teach it online. I knew what I did before was not going to be enough, 
and I decided that the best course of action was to meticulously prepare for 
it. 
The first thing I did was to identify the potential challenges my students 
were going to face during the semester. I was aware that the weight of the 
pandemic was not distributed equally throughout the student population. 
I knew some of my students had more responsibilities outside my course 
and, thanks to the pandemic, many of them had to face challenges that were 
unprecedented: Some of them were in different time zones, some of them 
did not have a quiet space to participate in class, some of them had to work 
full time to ease the financial hardships, some of them had to take care of 
their loved ones, some of them were sick themselves. 
Online courses were particularly challenging for students who were 
enrolled at a traditionally in-person university. In a normal semester, they 
could get away with just showing up to the classroom and catching up 
with what was happening at the moment. Online courses require higher 
student awareness of how the course is designed and the logistics behind 
it. For example, an online course requires the students to properly navigate 
the course management system, in our case Canvas, that would contain 
Vignette: Structure and Organization  |  35
everything from the materials and the assessments to the link for the 
synchronous meetings. However, students are not always well-versed in the 
platform and struggle when encountering a lack of structure on the website. 
How could I make my course easy to engage in, uphold the quality 
standards required by the university, and accommodate the emerging needs 
of my students? Based on my students’ feedback from the previous semester 
teaching, I knew the highly structured lessons I planned were a strength. 
I contemplated how I could transfer my perspective on lesson planning to 
other key aspects of the course. 
I carefully planned every step of the course in a way that would intuitively 
lead to student success. This plan covered aspects from the general 
progression of the course throughout the semester, to the specific structure 
of each lesson. For example, I created a template of how the usual lesson 
was going to look, specifying the responsibilities of the instructor and the 
students before, during, and after the class meeting (Figure 1). At the start 
of the semester, I reviewed this template with the students, making sure 
we all knew what was expected. The key objective of this figure was to give 
the students confidence by allowing them to be informed and empowered 
during each lesson. 
Figure 2.1 Overall plan presented to the students at the start of the semester. 
To address the innate challenges associated with the need for technology 
proficiency in an online course, I tried to make the Canvas site as clean 
and intuitive as possible. The homepage contained only the key information 
36  |  Vignette: Structure and Organization
that the students needed, including a description of the course, my contact 
information and links to the syllabus, the schedule, and the Zoom address 
that we used to meet every week. I made sure the links needed to access the 
class recordings and assessments were easy to find and intuitive to follow. 
I also reflected on the best way to organize the materials needed to study. 
The course subjects were mainly taught through lectures with incorporated 
active learning strategies. Each lesson I designed contained a set of 
documents that included the learning goals, the annotated slides, and the 
recorded lectures. All of these documents were uploaded to the Canvas site 
before or right after the meeting session. The key aspect of the organization 
approach that I implemented in all documents that I uploaded was a carefully 
designed labeling system. 
I assigned a number to each subject based on the chronological order in 
which they were reviewed. Each document label started with the number 
assigned to the subject the lesson covered. This way, the learning goals, 
slides, and recorded lectures could easily be associated with each other just 
by looking at the label. Since the document names started with a number, 
they were organized chronologically by default on the website or even in 
each student’s personal file management system. This approach made it 
intuitive for the students to access the documents when needed. 
I implemented these strategies throughout the semester, and I frequently 
reflection on both their effectiveness and their impact on the students. 
Based on comments from the class survey, the strategies I put in place 
helped the students face the challenges derived from the COVID-19 
pandemic and concentrate on the goal of the course: learning biochemistry. 
Furthermore, by having a detailed structure and plan to follow, it allowed me 
as an instructor to have flexibility to adapt to my own challenges. I think the 
most valuable component of my teaching experience as a graduate student 
is the impact I had on my students. The actions I took to be more inclusive 
and facilitate learning in this unexpected online setting were reflected in 
the student feedback. I was particularly pleased to receive comments that 
specifically addressed how the way I taught the course eased the difficulty 
of online learning during a pandemic by students at a traditionally in-person 
university: 
“We always knew what was expected of us in that class and I 
appreciate the structure of the class. The structure of the class 
helped with having the discipline for online schooling.” 
Vignette: Structure and Organization  |  37
“Professor Didier did a great job having all of his material organized 
on canvas and a great schedule. He made the material easy to 
understand. I struggle in chemistry, but this has been the best 
chemistry course and the one I am doing the best in at Virginia Tech.” 
“The style in which this course was conducted was exactly what I 
would want. This was my most organized course and I always knew 
exactly what I had to do in order to succeed. It was very 
straightforward.”

3. Indigenizing Your Classroom:
A Practice in Inclusive Pedagogy
QUALLA KETCHUM 
Introduction 
Expanding diversity is a national imperative in education as universities 
work to better serve populations that are underserved in higher education. 
Education research has shown the importance of students being able to 
see themselves in their chosen field, particularly for women and students 
of color (Rodriguez & Blaney, 2020). Representation matters, affecting our 
students’ sense of belonging in our educational areas, departments, and 
programs. It is an important step as educators to disrupt outdated and 
colonized notions or structures, even in small ways, to help improve this 
identity in our students. This change can be done by incorporating inclusive 
pedagogical practices into our classrooms, including raising the voices and 
works of those who have historically not been heard in our fields. Culturally 
Responsive Teaching can help increase student competencies and support 
diverse students to feel more connected in the classroom environment 
(Bazron, Osher & Fleischman, 2005). Culturally responsive educational 
practices are important for a new university educator because the university 
environment often has a variety of students from many different cultural 
backgrounds, and knowledge of these practices will help faculty creatively 
adapt their teaching to that environment.

This chapter will discuss culturally responsive teaching practices, focusing 
particularly on including Indigenous knowledge, techniques, and voices in 
the classroom and how doing so will benefit all students, not just Indigenous 
students. I will highlight examples of experiences of Indigenous people to 
illustrate the importance of culturally responsive teaching practices, explain 
culturally responsive practices employed in my teaching practice, and 
demonstrate how these practices may be included in your classroom in a 
culturally responsive and respectful way. 
This chapter will discuss… 
• 
The experiences of Indigenous people in the United States 
and their relationship to education. 
• 
What Culturally Responsive Teaching is and how to 
implement a few culturally responsive teaching practices. 
• 
The value of including Indigenous knowledge and voices 
within the classroom. 
Being Indigenous in the Academy—My 
Positionality 
It is a traditional practice by Indigenous people to introduce ourselves first 
by our community and people in our language. This practice mirrors recent 
calls for researchers and educators to be transparent in their positionality as 
well as their personal history and perspectives, especially when working with 
Native communities (Canada & Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, 
1996; Castagno & Brayboy, 2008; Haynes Writer, 2008). Haynes Writer (2008) 
40  |  Indigenizing Your Classroom
also wrote about the importance of Indigenous perspectives to those outside 
of the Indigenous community in creating this culturally responsive work, 
stating: 
Our stories and our words are, as well, offerings to non-Indigenous 
people so they may come to know and move into ally-ship with us for 
that needed transformative work. (p. 10) 
I am Qualla 
 (qua-la) Ketchum, and I am a citizen of the Cherokee 
Nation. I grew up within the Nation’s boundaries in what is also known as 
northeastern Oklahoma. My technical background has been in Biological 
Systems or Agricultural Engineering. As an Indigenous student, I have had 
firsthand experience with the struggle to connect engineering to my culture. 
This struggle has been identified as one of the factors impacting why more 
Native Americans don’t become engineers (Kant et al., 2015). I have had to 
work hard to bring together these different sides of myself—the engineer 
and the Cherokee and the educator—and it is a continuing process. 
I want to acknowledge my white-privilege as a white-passing Native 
woman, meaning that others do not immediately recognize my identity as 
a minority. Because of my phenotype, I am seen by society as white, and 
thus I carry that privilege. I acknowledge that my experience is not the same 
as those who are automatically coded as a person of color by the dominant 
culture. I can only speak for myself and my experience. There are more 
than 573 different Indigenous Nations within the United States which means 
more than 573 different cultures, languages, histories, and sets of issues. I 
cannot speak for other Indigenous nations or even for everyone within my 
Indigenous Nation. The experiences and thoughts expressed here are my 
perspective as both an Indigenous student and an instructor. It should not 
be assumed that all Indigenous people experience the academy or hold the 
same truths as I do. 
As a whole, Indigenous people have had a long, storied history with the 
US education system. Teaching and learning have always been important 
values in our cultures, mostly in informal ways through our family systems. 
As an example, the Cherokee Nation built the first institutions of higher 
education west of Mississippi for both Cherokee men and women as a way of 
reclaiming our ways of being after our forced removal to Indian Territory in 
the mid-1800s (Foreman, 1982). However, education was then turned into a 
weapon used against Indigenous Nations by the US government. The Curtis 
Indigenizing Your Classroom  |  41
Act of 1898 was used to dissolve tribal institutions of the Five Civilized Tribes, 
including the Cherokee seminaries (Conley, 2007). This action paved the way 
for residential boarding schools and the deeply rooted scars that still exist 
today from this era in Indigenous communities. For many of our Indigenous 
nations, these schools, where native children were forced away from their 
families to become “civilized,” were our first real experience with a formal 
education system. The horrors in these schools haunt many today (NPR, 
2008), but these schools are not as far in the past as one might wish to 
think. In 1969, one-third of Native students were still enrolled in schools 
operated by the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE). Now, nearly 50 years later, 
the bureau still educates 40,000 Native students in over 180 schools (NPR, 
2008). These schools’ effects on Indigenous families are still felt every day, 
especially when it comes to feelings toward education. On reservations in 
Montana, educators and Indigenous leaders have discussed that families do 
not seem to value or believe in formal education (Field, 2016). 
It is with an understanding of these histories and beliefs that the statistics 
for Native Americans in education become more clear. Native Americans 
have the lowest graduation rate in comparison to other minority 
populations. We are the least likely demographic to enroll in college and are 
the second least likely to graduate on time (Field, 2016). Only seven out of 
every 100 Native American kindergarteners earn a bachelor’s degree (Begay-
Campbell, 2016). Nearly fifty percent of Native American K-12 students attend 
a public school where the full range of math and science courses are not 
being offered (Begay-Campbell, 2016). I, personally, went to a public school 
that fell within this category. This performance gap can also be attributed 
to a lack of funding, qualified teachers, technology, and internet access (May 
& Chubin, 2003). From 2005 to 2015, the percentage of 25- to 29-year olds 
holding at least bachelor’s degrees increased for all racial and ethnic groups 
except Native Americans (Field, 2016). 
I share all of this as a framework for understanding why culturally 
responsive teaching and inclusive pedagogical practices are important to 
include in our classrooms. Because of the highly colonized nature of the 
United States education system and society as a whole, many educators 
are not aware of this history and experience of Native Americans. We must 
understand where we have been and where others are coming from when 
we wish to create and hold welcoming spaces within our classrooms.

Culturally Responsive Teaching: What Is It? 
Many new educators have great enthusiasm and commitment to teaching 
their students well but do not always have the skills necessary for success 
in the environment in which they teach (McHenry, 2018). Educators also 
sometimes feel unprepared to teach students of different cultures (McHenry, 
2018). This section will explain the purpose and implementation of culturally 
responsive teaching practices in your classroom. 
Culturally responsive teaching builds a cognizance of the value of cultural 
differences into the classroom and avoids seeing cultural differences as 
negatives (Morgan, 2009). Culturally responsive education can include the 
use of culturally relevant examples and assessments and respectful 
classroom-management approaches (Bazron et al., 2005). Employing 
culturally responsive educational practices can help students feel a greater 
sense of belonging in the classroom (Bazron et al., 2005), potentially leading 
to increased motivation for learning. 
Culturally responsive teaching is instructing in a way that embraces the 
idea that culture plays a role in learning (Harmon, 2012). Students come to 
the classroom with their unique perspectives, including their histories and 
respective cultures, such as Indigenous cultures. Students who are a part 
of a different culture may feel that they do not “belong” in the classroom if 
references used in the lesson reflect only one group. Using examples that 
include a variety of groups can help enrich the class and student learning. 
It is useful to note that the word “culture” in culturally responsive teaching 
is used broadly, as cultures can vary within a particular group or system. 
For example, cultures of Indigenous peoples can be different from one 
Indigenous nation to another, and while each individual does not necessarily 
feel qualified or able to speak for everyone in their own nation, much less 
that of all Indigenous cultures, they may feel prepared to offer their personal 
perspective on their place within it. Culture can even refer to the culture of 
a particular geographic area or “culture of place.” For example, the culture 
in rural Appalachia is different from the culture in an East Coast inner city. 
Teaching using culturally responsive practices in each of these places would 
look different (McHenry, 2018). McHenry (2018) notes that moving to rural 
Appalachia and teaching the children of coal miners was challenging for 
her, as the students were food insecure and parents were stressed. Having 
no training in the practice of cultural humility, she states that she decided 
Indigenizing Your Classroom  |  43
that her students simply needed more schooling and didn’t understand until 
much later that while she could drill her students on math facts, she couldn’t 
fill their stomachs or truly understand the “values, behaviors, language, and 
culture that defined them and their families.” Knowing details such as the 
strengths, values, and challenges of different cultures helps you to tailor your 
lessons specifically to the students you are teaching. 
Cognizance of a historical lens is important when engaging in culturally 
responsive educational practices (Harmon, 2012). Cultural traditions may be 
linked to that culture’s unique history, which can manifest in your class 
through differences in the ways students respond to questions, differences 
in their viewpoints, and differences in their perspectives. For example, 
Indigenous students sometimes, but not always, express a mistrust of the 
US government and educational system based on historical knowledge of 
relations between Native people and the US government, as discussed in 
the previous section. This mistrust perpetuates both community attitudes 
toward education and student fears of going away for higher education. 
This historical context for the US education system can provide greater 
insight into how different activities and resources will affect other students 
in the classroom. For example, students from various backgrounds will have 
different responses to an assigned reading of the “Students’ Right to Their 
Own Language” statement from the Conference on College Composition and 
Communication. In particular, Indigenous students have described strong 
reactions to the quotes in the statement about how learning a new dialect 
of language in the academy is “to some extent a rejection of one’s culture.” 
Intergenerational trauma from boarding schools stealing language and 
ancestral knowledge from Indigenous communities can result in strong 
feelings arising that would not affect students from other cultural 
backgrounds. Recognizing and holding space for these students and 
backgrounds helps students feel more included in the academic 
environment. It even allows them to gain a sense of empowerment and 
ownership of their stories (Harmon, 2012). 
Interestingly, culturally responsive education does more than empower 
the students. It empowers educators! Educators who use culturally 
responsive teaching in the classroom can feel empowered by the exciting 
sense of being a facilitator in the school, discussions are richer, and true 
connections are made between people and information (Harmon, 2012). 
Engaging in culturally responsive teaching practices is fun for the educator 
44  |  Indigenizing Your Classroom
as well! And who would not want to make the class more enjoyable to 
teach? As an added plus, when an educator is exuding more enthusiasm, that 
excitement is likely to be contagious for students. 
Implementation 
There are many different ways to implement culturally responsive 
educational practices in the classroom. One is to incorporate cultural 
references into the lessons in the examples used to explain concepts. The 
use of cultural references can best be achieved by weaving them into the 
class in a meaningful and intentional way (Ladson-Billings, 1994). For 
example, one Indigenous colleague often uses traditional storytelling in her 
teaching while I explicitly use my Cherokee Community Values to guide my 
classroom interactions. Many majority identity educators express interest in 
wanting to share these different references with their students but worry 
about having something to share or sharing incorrect information. As 
previously discussed, one’s ethnic/racial identity is only one piece of culture. 
One educator could use their family motto as a way to center different 
cultural examples holistically. By honestly sharing of themselves and their 
cultures first, the other examples utilized in class can be received with more 
power and purpose than those just seemingly tacked on and unconnected to 
the class. 
Another way to incorporate other voices in class is to ensure that other 
perspectives and accomplishments are included when discussing a 
particular field’s history. For example, the history of STEM (science, 
technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields is often documented as 
very Eurocentric, leaving out many other perspectives. Engineering feats 
such as the Inca Road System or the complex water-drainage systems of the 
southwestern US nations are frequently left unmentioned while the histories 
of people in Europe take center stage. Many of the courses taught do not 
have a discussion of history included in the lesson plans. If such a discussion 
seems overwhelming or difficult to include, a good first step is starting each 
class with a quote or person of the week that represents diverse perspectives 
and accomplishments particular to the field of study. This is another way to 
use culturally responsive teaching practices to highlight voices that are often 
Indigenizing Your Classroom  |  45
left out of these conversations. A word of caution, however: This step is often 
best used in conjunction with the previous step of incorporating cultural 
references. The use of these quotes and references needs to be sincere and 
thoughtful. Instructors should be prepared to educate themselves during the 
planning and implementation of this process. Make cultural references part 
of the lesson structure, or invite students to present examples of their own 
so that the cultures present in the class may come out in the discussion. 
Incorporating culturally responsive teaching into a specific class can feel a 
little daunting for a new educator at first. The easiest place to start is with 
getting to know the students and what communities they represent. Having 
students introduce themselves is a great way to begin to get to know them 
and better understand their perspectives. In my classes, however, before 
they speak I first introduce myself in my native language. This shares a 
piece of myself and my culture with my students—an important step if I 
want to ask the same of my students. It also helps put any students from 
underrepresented perspectives, particularly from other Indigenous cultures, 
more at ease in academia and in my classroom. It is helpful to give space 
for every voice to be heard in the classroom while also avoiding pushing 
students to speak up if they are uncomfortable doing so. 
Another effective way to incorporate culturally responsive teaching 
practices in the classroom is to diversify the syllabus. It is important to 
examine the readings being used in your curriculum. By assigning particular 
readings, you are inadvertently telling your students which perspectives are 
important. In culturally responsive teaching, you want to make sure that the 
value culture has in the classroom is accurately depicted in your syllabus. 
Including a land acknowledgment statement in the syllabus is another easy 
way to create a welcoming space for all students in the classroom. For non-
Indigenous educators, this simple step works similarly as my introduction 
in my native language. It is an easy way to put Indigenous students in 
particular at ease and other students who value inclusion and different 
cultural perspectives. 
An exciting feature of culturally responsive teaching is its focus on the 
strengths that culture can bring to the learning, and the classroom 
community 
(McHenry, 
2018). 
Culturally 
responsive 
educational 
environments may incorporate culturally related music, food, language, or 
clothing (Eglash, Gilbert, & Foster, 2013). An individual may proudly express 
these cultural features from a particular culture as aspects of their personal 
style (Eglash et al., 2013). Incorporating items such as music or food can help 
46  |  Indigenizing Your Classroom
add enthusiasm to your lesson and the classroom, making them a great way 
to get students more engaged in learning. There are a number of strategies 
that support culturally responsive teaching. 
Syllabus Development 
Be intentional with what you put in your syllabus and how it’s 
communicated. Your syllabus sets the tone for the semester and is 
often your first introduction to your students. What inclusion 
statements are suggested or required by your institution? Ensure 
that your use of these statements is intentional and meaningful 
rather than tacked on at the end of the document out of obligation. 
Do they connect and align with the rest of your syllabus and how 
you manage your classroom? In culturally responsive teaching, you 
want to make sure that the syllabus accurately depicts the value 
culture has in the classroom. Diversify readings and ensure multiple 
perspectives are included and valued. Include a land 
acknowledgment statement at the beginning of your syllabus. 
Resources for developing this statement can be found at 
https://nativegov.org/a-guide-to-indigenous-land-
acknowledgment/ 
Indigenizing Your Classroom  |  47
Tips for Culturally Responsive Teaching 
•
Start class with a land acknowledgment statement and include one in
your syllabus.
•
Teach to people, not your topic, using student-centered strategies.
•
Educate yourself on the historical context in which you are teaching.
Ask questions!
•
Do a self-assessment of your own vocabulary, responses, and privilege.
•
Use culturally related examples to explain concepts or invite students
to offer up their models.
•
Avoid assuming you know a student’s culture. That student may
surprise you!
•
Make space/time in your lessons for students of different cultures,
such as Indigenous students, to speak up if they wish to share.
•
Act as a facilitator, rather than a lecturer, for your students
Conclusion 
Your teaching, and your students’ learning, can benefit from culturally 
responsive practices. Culturally responsive teaching helps increase students’ 
sense of belonging and creates a welcoming space within our classroom. An 
awareness of historical context is also important when engaging in culturally 
responsive educational practices. It helps to understand where both we as 
educators and our students are coming from before entering the classroom. 
Indigenous practices, knowledge, and voices can be incorporated into the 
school through culturally responsive teaching practices, improving learning 
for all students. Culturally responsive teaching practices can make your class 
a more dynamic, engaging atmosphere where references to various cultures 
are used to help illustrate concepts and enrich the lesson.

4. Teaching Practices for
Student-Centered Learning
Online
RACHEL MACK 
Introduction 
Welcome to the online teaching chapter! Teaching online is not only fun, but 
it also has advantages for both you and your students. In my online teaching, 
I have enjoyed the flexibility (Bates, 2012) of the online teaching process. 
While online education can initially seem intimidating to new graduate 
teaching assistants (TAs) and faculty, if you are feeling overwhelmed by it, 
you are not alone. Seasoned faculty sometimes have difficulty with online 
teaching, especially if they are not used to the format. When COVID-19 
forced face-to-face classes to become online classes, some faculty and 
teaching assistants in academia were left scrambling to both meet the needs 
of students and present their material well (Kamenetz, 2020). Moving a class 
online can be especially challenging for those who are not well-versed in 
online teaching tools, or who are accustomed to using lecture-only teaching 
formats. However, an online course doesn’t need to be a challenge to create 
and implement.

If you find yourself overwhelmed at the prospect of teaching an online 
course, you may be overthinking it. There are ways to make your online 
course simple and useful at the same time. In this chapter, I will walk through 
the components necessary for a basic, easy-to-implement online course, so 
that you may quickly set yourself up for the delivery of effective teaching for 
your students. 
In my teaching, I have seen critical thinking elevated by highlighting 
student questions and interests, which in online classes can make space for 
student ideas to influence the direction of the lessons. Student-centered 
practices that achieve this include, but are not limited to, being a facilitator 
rather than a lecturer, focusing on what students want to know, and 
encouraging students to brainstorm their own ideas on the topic. Read on 
for more detail about using student-centered practices to enhance online 
teaching. 
This chapter will discuss… 
•
How to make an online course more student-centered.
•
How to quickly convert from a face-to-face course to an
online course.
•
Preventing yourself from throwing all of your efforts into
creating your online course.
•
Creating online experiences that students will enjoy.
Online learning environments can be challenging for teachers who wish to 
promote student-centered teaching practices. Teachers of online courses 
cannot always observe students to gauge whether their students are 
responding well to the lesson. Online courses can be tricky for those 
teachers who wish to encourage student-teacher and peer-peer 
interactions. They can pose challenges for teachers who want to promote 
Student-Centered Learning Online  |  53
motivation to learn through activities, course content, and assessment 
(Briggs, 2015). Teachers wish to see students engaged, but the inherent 
physical separation of students and instructors that exists in online 
coursework can pose unique challenges for the use of student-centered 
teaching (Briggs, 2015). However, there are many ways that student-centered 
teaching practices can enhance the online classroom. With the employment 
of student-centered teaching practices, online courses can seem less 
mechanical for learners. Student-centered learning practices create a class 
atmosphere of interaction, focusing on learner needs, interests, and 
inquiries (ED, 2010). Using student-centered learning practices in online 
teaching helps students to become active participants in their learning 
through activities such as partnering in the development of course content, 
interacting with peers electronically, and making decisions on how learning 
will occur. Student-centered learning also avoids the use of rote 
memorization in teaching concepts and favors the encouragement of critical 
thinking in students (Schunk, 2012). 
Beginning to Go Online: Planning Your Online 
Course 
It is beneficial to plan the syllabus, the objectives, and the assignments to 
have a solid map to follow. Learning objectives are statements of what your 
students should be able to do after receiving your instruction (University 
of Colorado, 2007). The material you present should relate to your lesson’s 
objectives. This helps to focus the lesson and guide the students’ efforts as 
they work through the material. Therefore, identifying the objectives you will 
have for the class and for each lesson allows you to organize your lessons for 
teaching online more rapidly. Remember that lessons, and their objectives, 
do not need to be intricately written to be effective, and bullet points can 
help you to outline your lessons quickly. 
54  |  Student-Centered Learning Online
Syllabus Development 
• 
Use the syllabus to clearly state the platform(s) you plan to 
use, and inform students of any additional technology or 
materials they should have. 
• 
Consider providing a how-to guide for students not familiar 
with the technology you use for the course. 
• 
If you use a synchronous web-based platform that requires 
clicking on a common link, consider including that link in the 
syllabus. 
• 
When posting the syllabus online, clearly title the file so 
students can identify it. 
• 
Use the syllabus to include information about activities in 
which students will interact in the online setting. 
• 
Include information about campus resources on information 
technology services, and accessibility services. 
• 
Use the syllabus to encourage students to contact you 
immediately if they encounter, or expect to encounter, 
challenges with access to course. 
When planning your course, you should also be aware that each class is 
different in practice, and you may not end up sticking to your plans precisely. 
In my teaching, I have found that while it is not typical for a class to stick 
precisely to my lesson plan, I can get them to work toward learning goals 
each week. Within the planned objectives, being flexible provides space for 
students to voice interest in a different direction than the lesson plan may 
lead. Keeping the class centered on the students helps them feel that they 
have a stake in the lesson, allowing them to bring their ideas to the table, and 
Student-Centered Learning Online  |  55
ultimately increases their engagement (McCarthy, 2015). Therefore, planning 
for flexibility in the course’s flow, within your objectives, is a good start 
towards setting up your online class to be firmly focused on your students. 
How to Speedily Convert a Face-to-Face Course 
to an Online Format 
Before we launch into student-centered online learning, we first need to 
discuss how to set up an effective online course. So you want to convert a 
class to an online format quickly, but you are not sure where to start? First, 
think about whether you would like your class’s sessions to be synchronous 
or asynchronous. 
In a synchronous course, you and your students will meet at the same 
time (Cohn & Seltzer, 2020). An example is using a synchronous web-based 
platform to communicate with students at regular intervals. For an 
asynchronous course, you prepare your lessons in advance for the students 
to access at a later time (Cohn & Seltzer, 2020). An example of asynchronous 
course design is posting lessons and course materials for students to access 
via a course management system. 
There are advantages and disadvantages to each approach. Synchronous 
teaching can facilitate responsive communication and allows immediate 
personal engagement with students (Cohn & Seltzer, 2020). However, it may 
be challenging to schedule with everyone, and it has the potential for access 
or technical difficulties that impede its use for you or your students (Cohn 
& Seltzer, 2020; Flaherty, 2020). Asynchronous instruction is more flexible, 
self-paced, and allows you to retain your posted past lessons, but could 
reduce student engagement or understanding of your instruction (Cohn & 
Seltzer, 2020; Flaherty, 2020). I discuss options for handling the negatives 
associated with these approaches later in the chapter. For now, let’s continue 
brainstorming how to quickly and effectively set up your online class. 
56  |  Student-Centered Learning Online
Increasing Accessibility 
Sometimes students have challenges accessing course materials. Some ways 
that you can make your class more accessible for your students include 
creating transcripts of any videos you use in your teaching (Flaherty, 2020), 
including descriptions of any videos you use, and using captioning software 
to assist with student comprehension of your videos. You may also consider 
having assignments open long enough to capture all time zones, so all 
students may participate at a reasonable time. Additionally, crowdsourcing 
the class notes can help increase accessibility. Encourage student volunteers 
to post their class notes to a common location so everyone in the class can 
view them. Alternatively, create an assignment for a group of students to 
post the notes each week. 
The next consideration is how you prefer to present your material. 
Potential options include pre-recording your lessons, maintaining a live class 
via a web-based platform, or using a format with no video of your teaching, 
but including resources plus an online discussion (Cohn & Seltzer, 2020). You 
could also customize your course’s presentation by combining the aspects 
you prefer from each of these options. Each option has its advantages and 
disadvantages. 
If you are used to lecturing, pre-recorded lectures have the advantage 
of allowing you to teach as you usually would. However, students may find 
watching a pre-recorded video of you dull, so be sure to let your personality 
come through as you teach and avoid coming across as scripted. Keep your 
videos short (Myers, 2014)! A 5- to 7-minute video is sufficient, and if you 
have a longer lecture, it is good to break it into smaller pieces. Smaller videos 
are easier for you to upload and easier for students to watch (Myers, 2014). 
Search your lessons for where they naturally break into smaller units suitable 
for presentation in short videos (Myers, 2014). When you are recording 
yourself, speak like students are listening! If students are taking notes from 
your lectures, speak slowly enough that students can write without pausing 
the video. While students have the option of backing up the video, if they 
missed something, they will not be happy about having to do that, so it is 
best to speak at a pace at which students can easily follow. 
To quickly use a pre-recorded lecture format for teaching online, try an 
approach that uses a lecture video, a quiz, and a live discussion (Johnson, 
2020). First, create your module in your course management system. Then, 
Student-Centered Learning Online  |  57
create a video of your lecture (Johnson, 2020). You can create a video of 
your slides, where you provide narration (Johnson, 2020); or a video where 
students see you, or that feature some props or materials you are using 
to teach that day. A low-point-value online quiz posted on your course 
management system can serve as a way to check student understanding 
(Johnson, 2020). Finally, if you wish, you can engage students in a virtual class 
discussion using a course management system, where you and your students 
are all online at once (Johnson, 2020). Alternatively, you can have several 
such meetings to accommodate small group discussions. 
To quickly create an online course using a live discussion format, you can 
use a read, journal, discussion approach (Johnson, 2020). First, create your 
module in a course management system, making its title easy for students to 
identify (Johnson, 2020). Then, upload any reading material, videos, or links 
you wish to include in your module (Johnson, 2020). Let students reflect on 
the content through a reflection assignment (Johnson, 2020) or a discussion 
online in the course management system. Finally, send students a link for 
your virtual class meeting via a synchronous web-based platform, and have 
students discuss the material they read (Johnson, 2020). 
Keeping the live-class feel to your course by regularly meeting using a 
web-based synchronous platform offers the ability to change gears and 
immediately address a student’s question. The lesson’s interactivity benefits 
the participants as the lesson flows in the direction of student interest, 
making space for student-centered learning to occur (McCarthy, 2015). 
However, connectivity issues can be problematic for you or the students, 
so you should have a secondary plan to use the chat feature or different 
software if connectivity is a little spotty. To preserve student privacy, 
consider giving your students the option of not turning on their video 
cameras and only participating through audio or chat. 
A way to teach without posting a video of your teaching is to post links, 
annotated slides (Cohn & Seltzer, 2020), articles, or publicly available videos 
(Myers, 2014) for students to review and discuss. The flexibility inherent 
in using a diversity of posted materials is especially helpful when teaching 
students with varying interests. If you use a discussion, it is useful to guide 
students on length, content, and classroom standards for interaction with 
others. You can support standards rules for discussions by addressing them 
on the syllabus, sending a class announcement, participating in the debate 
yourself, or posting your guidelines for conversations along with the 
assignment. You may find it beneficial to share a discussion rubric along with 
58  |  Student-Centered Learning Online
your discussion assignment so that expectations are clear. You can adapt the 
read, journal, discussion format (Johnson, 2020) to teaching without posting 
any videos of yourself by making the class discussion online-only, such as in 
a discussion board of your course management system. 
Student-Centered Practices for Engaging 
Students from the Start 
At the beginning of your online class, your students may not know each 
other. Some may be friends taking the course together, but others may 
not know who else is in the class. An excellent way to begin the semester 
is to have students introduce themselves, even if it is through an online 
discussion board. For a large class, it may be helpful to break students into 
smaller groups, such as online discussion board groups or breakout rooms, 
and have introductions within the group. The introductions show who is in 
the class, and many students will share details about why they are in the 
class. From a teaching perspective, this information is absolute gold because 
it helps in understanding how learning can be adapted to meet the students’ 
needs in the class. The student’s active role in the construction of knowledge 
within the classroom’s social environment is a characteristic of student-
centered learning (Peters, 2009). 
Another exercise that I find very useful was taught to me by the head of 
Virginia Tech’s Graduate Teaching Scholars Program. This exercise involves 
participatory planning (Sullivan, 1996), with students sharing what they 
would most like to learn in the class. Similar to the introductions, student 
comments give insight into their reasons for taking the course, while 
providing the educator with direct statements about the students’ top 
interests. Participatory planning is excellent for helping me adapt my lessons 
to teach to the specific content that most interests the class, enabling 
learner input to drive the direction of the course (Peters, 2009). At the 
beginning of the semester, I ask students to provide this information, and I 
make a note of those interests so I am aware of what they want to know. 
Student-Centered Learning Online  |  59
Tips for Student-Centered Beginnings 
• Ask your students what THEY want to know—let them help decide 
course content (Schunk, 2012). 
• Give students choices about how they would prefer class to be 
administered (Peters, 2009). 
• Use think-pair-share activities. Yes, you can do this online! Encourage 
interaction among students in small online groups and share them with 
the rest of the class. 
• Be a facilitator, not a lecturer. Facilitate open-ended, inquiry-based 
discussions (Peters, 2009). 
• Encourage students to offer up their ideas and new ways of 
approaching a topic (Brown, 2008). 
• Encourage critical thinking over memorization. 
Adapting Your Teaching to Work Well Online 
Perhaps you feel uneasy about adapting your teaching to the online 
environment. This feeling may be especially true if you are used to face-to-
face lecturing and observing the understanding on the faces of your students 
as you speak. You may have to make some changes to the way you typically 
teach, but these changes do not have to be significant. Interaction between 
teachers and students can occur through online discussions, email, teacher-
student messages/chats (Bennett & Lockyer, 2004), and synchronous web-
based platform meetings. Use the information presented above to guide you 
in choosing the best options for your online teaching. Even if you make 
a mistake, keeping a positive attitude will help you be a successful online 
teacher. Confidence, adaptability, and positivity are characteristics 
identified 
in 
online 
facilitators 
conducive 
to 
supporting 
student 
understanding and meaning-making (Salmon, 2000, as cited in Bennett & 
Lockyer, 2004). So stay positive about your online teaching! 
A great way of connecting with students in an online class is by being you. 
That means that you should not aim for perfectionism, as nobody is perfect, 
and you will only end up disappointing yourself and your students. Many of 
60  |  Student-Centered Learning Online
your students are looking up to you and are rooting for you to teach the class 
well. If it is your first time teaching an online course, you may make some 
mistakes, but remember that students are surprisingly forgiving when they 
know you are trying. You do not have to try to get a teaching award on your 
first try in online teaching. Your attitude will shape the students’ experiences 
in the course. If you have a good, positive attitude, students will notice and 
they will appreciate that you are yourself even if everything does not go 
perfectly the first time. When you stay positive, it also helps your students 
to focus less on content transmission and more on learning (Salmon, 2000, 
as cited in Bennett & Lockyer, 2004). This positive behavior helps students 
connect better with you and reduce the psychological distance between 
students and teachers. It also helps mitigate the potential for the online 
course to become impersonal. Even online students want to learn from a 
person, not a robot. 
Who Takes Online Courses? 
The differences between online teaching and face-to-face teaching also 
affect who you teach. The average student you see in an online class can be 
different than those who may enroll in your traditional courses. One study 
shows that compared to other majors, business majors are more likely to 
take online classes (Mann, 2012). Those in the bench sciences are the least 
likely to take online courses (Mann, 2012). Students residing out-of-state 
are more likely to take online classes than in-state students, and freshman 
are more likely to take online coursework than seniors (Mann, 2012). Such 
differences in the types of students you see in online classes can affect how 
you teach the class. In my own experience teaching online, I have noted a 
higher number of students who are unconventional and have busy schedules, 
such as people who work full- or part-time. More of my students in my 
online teaching practice have been student-athletes. Other students took 
heavy course loads and needed the convenience of not showing up to a 
regularly scheduled class. 
Student-Centered Learning Online  |  61
What does a different type of student mean for your instruction? Teaching 
a mixture of nontraditional students and traditional students means you will 
need to be flexible. Here are some tips from my online teaching practice: 
• Have regular days when assignments are due, so students always 
expect to turn in something those days. 
• Contact any stragglers as soon as you notice that they are falling 
behind. You are often the only teacher who reaches out to them. 
• Message the class at least once a week to keep them on track, 
reminding them of what is due that week. Students appreciate this 
reminder. 
• Issues with module access, course requirements, or personal 
challenges the students face are often emailed to me by students within 
24 hours of my weekly message to my class. From my experience 
teaching online, I can say that, but for my reminder message, some 
students in my online courses would not have remembered to begin 
their online assignments until it was too late. 
Teaching Labs Online 
When teaching your lab face-to-face, students have direct access to the 
lab equipment, so how do you teach a lab online? Advantages to teaching 
labs online include the obvious: Students cannot easily hurt their peers 
or you if they are taking the lab virtually. If they get bored, they will not 
likely start fiddling with the Bunsen burners, or playing with the chemicals, 
as students in a face-to-face lab might. Disadvantages include the lack of 
direct access to laboratory equipment (Taft, 2020), so students may not 
feel that they are getting the first-hand experience of watching laboratory 
procedures. When possible, and especially if students emulate you as you 
lead an experiment, build your virtual lab around items that they can find 
in their homes (Taft, 2020). Avoid using a cookbook approach to your lab, 
which removes student decision making from the process and is teacher-
centered rather than student-centered (Peters, 2010). Be mindful of what 
is missing in a virtual lab and fill in your teaching gap. Items with scents, 
such as certain chemicals, molds, and even farm animals, cannot be smelled 
62  |  Student-Centered Learning Online
virtually. Position your camera so that students can see small items you want 
them to notice, such as a glass slide. Provide a detailed description of any 
missing elements, or those less accessible to their senses, due to the virtual 
format of the lab. It won’t just make the lab more real for the students; it will 
make it more fun. 
Student-Centered Learning Online: Building 
Community 
Building community is important to any classroom. However, in an online 
class, it is especially important to build community. Students taking online 
classes can feel that the human element of learning is lessened in the online 
class format. Sometimes, students just crave the experience of talking with 
others when learning. There are several ways in which you can make the 
online classroom feel less mechanical and impersonal, and in which you can 
build classroom community. 
Encourage Interaction 
There are various ways that you can encourage interaction in your 
classroom. You can build classroom community, increase student decision 
making, use group work, and harness online platforms to mimic the back-
and-forth dynamic of a face-to-face classroom. Below, I discuss each of 
these items in more detail. 
One way that you can build community is by encouraging students to 
increase their interactions with each other. Engagement activities can help 
students connect with one another and feel that the class matters to them 
(VT TLOS, n.d.). Some ways you might increase student engagement through 
student-centered activities include using roleplay, simulation, service 
learning, drama, a simulation, and problem-based learning (Freiberg 
&Driscoll, 1999). Examples of applying a few of these suggestions include 
giving students an exercise where they each take on a character surrounding 
an issue related to your material or having students work to solve a real-
Student-Centered Learning Online  |  63
world problem (Freiberg & Driscoll, 1999). In online discussions, you may 
consider assigning your students different titles for roles. For example, roles 
you may give include those of a responder, a summarizer, or someone who 
introduces additional resources (Cohn & Seltzer, 2020). Each student takes 
on their role while participating in the discussion. A responder responds 
to others in the discussion, and the summarizer breaks larger selections or 
comments down into more easily digestible statements. The person who 
introduces additional resources finds material that helps support the debate, 
such as an article about the topic. Having roles helps structure the 
discussion while providing each student a good opportunity to contribute to 
its depth. 
Give your online students choices and provide room for them to assist 
with class decision-making to help make your class more student centered 
(Brown, 2008). The opportunity to make decisions translates into making 
the course feel less electronic and more people centered. Many instructors 
use online discussions as assignments. When I use online discussions to get 
my students engaged, I provide several prompts for students and allow each 
student to choose which prompt(s) they wish to discuss. Letting the student 
choose their prompt will translate into each one engaging in the discussion 
they are the most interested in, leading to a richer conversation. Permitting 
students to choose their prompt adds enthusiasm to the class, and seeing 
who chooses which prompt makes the course more interesting for everyone. 
Using group work in your online teaching can help increase student 
interaction (VT TLOS, 2020). It is important when considering the use of 
group work to keep in mind those aspects of group work that drive students 
crazy. Many students can relate to the experience of being the only one 
in the group willing to do the work for the group project. Others may 
have had the anxiety-laden experience working with a group that does not 
begin the assignment until the night before it needs to be submitted. Other 
times, students in the group simply do not get along. Online classes have 
the potential to magnify these issues. Communication is not always optimal 
among students in an online course, and students may conduct all group 
project communications via email. Because students may not ever see each 
other’s faces in an online class, it can be easier for them to depersonalize 
communications with their fellow group members. Having students interact 
will promote connectivity among students and raise student perceptions of 
64  |  Student-Centered Learning Online
the course as a whole (VT TLOS, 2020). You can do this by placing students in 
small discussion groups online, which helps them connect as a small group 
while not feeling overwhelmed by comments of the whole class. 
Dividing students into small groups helps them have and enjoy deeper 
discussions than if the whole class engages in a debate. Research 
demonstrates that students perceive such groups as better for developing 
their critical thinking than a larger class discussion (Hamann, Pollock, & 
Wilson, 2012). Although small groups are beneficial, even whole-class 
discussions can be helpful to students, because they assist students in more 
clearly understanding concepts (Hamann et al., 2012). An issue with teaching 
online while using discussions is that they can lack the back-and-forth of an 
in-person conversation (Hamann et al., 2012). Therefore, it is important to be 
creative in getting students to interact. A way that I, and other colleagues, do 
this is to ask students to post their initial response to the discussion prompt 
early in the week’s lesson. Reactions to others are due later in the week, and 
students are encouraged to discuss more than what is “required.” Setting 
up online discussions in this way helps students to present their ideas, and 
then answer the points of others, using the online discussion board, while 
mimicking the back-and-forth dynamic of a face-to-face conversation. 
Other ways that you can help your class to develop that same back-
and-forth seen in a live discussion include having students participate in 
a small group chat or discussion using a synchronous web-based platform. 
I have also seen good results in a class when students record videos of 
themselves using the course management system’s video feature to present 
their responses to discussion prompts. Give students helpful feedback on 
those discussions and on any other assignments you give them online. 
Students are more motivated to learn when they receive personalized 
outreach (Boretz, 2012). 
Tips for Student-Centered Teaching Online 
• Ask students questions! (Brown, 2008). 
• Make the course personal by creating options for students to apply the 
coursework to themselves, their goals, or what is going on in their own 
lives. 
• Do not give direct answers. Lead students to solutions (Brown, 2008). 
Student-Centered Learning Online  |  65
•
Use activities like case studies, scenarios, and roleplaying that allow
students to explore options, create solutions, and solve problems.
•
Think carefully about your online assignments, walking yourself
through each task and what it entails. If you feel it might be online
busywork, the students probably will too!
•
Give students personalized feedback, considering their own interests,
goals, or aspirations. Sandwich a bad feedback sentence between two
good feedback sentences, so it ends on a positive.
Preventing Cheating 
Cheating can be a serious problem in online classes. Watson & Sottile (2010) 
found that while cheating did not occur at a higher rate in online courses 
than in face-to-face courses, the online students were more likely to get 
answers for online exams or quizzes from others. If you post a quiz or exam 
online, a student can share screenshots with other students or call their 
friends and tell them the questions. It can be challenging to know if a student 
is looking up the answers to an online quiz or exam. Some instructors handle 
this by putting a time limit on the exam, so students do not have spare 
time, but I do not personally advocate for this option, as it makes students 
feel that they do not have the time to show you what you know. And why 
do the assessment if the results cannot help you find out something about 
what the students have learned? Some educators try to find a “sweet spot” 
where the exam is tightly timed, but not too tightly. In my experience with 
timed assessments online, the educator is a poor judge of the appropriate 
exam length, and most underestimate how long their exams take. If you 
are considering tinkering with an assessment’s timing, you are probably 
going down the wrong online assessment road. Read below for some better 
approaches to avoiding cheating. 
66  |  Student-Centered Learning Online
Tips for Avoiding Cheating in Your Online Class 
• Make clear what constitutes cheating (Feeney, 2017). Define cheating on 
your syllabus. 
• If you have a quiz or exam, ask questions that are reasonable, not 
obscure. Obscure questions invite cheating. 
• Designate all exams as open-book (Barret-Fox, 2020). 
• Avoid assessing a speed-reading test. Remember, some students have 
English as a second language, while some students may have disabilities 
(which are not always diagnosed before they attend college!). 
• Use questions that require students to analyze, explain, evaluate, 
create, and otherwise demonstrate their mastery of the material 
(Budhai, 2020). These strategies make their answers personalized. 
• Offer low-stakes quizzes, so the likelihood of cheating is decreased 
(Feeney, 2017). 
• Don’t have quizzes or exams at all. Have subjective assignments 
(Watson & Sottile 2010). Have students turn in all assignments as 
discussion posts and papers, where they are required to apply the 
material they learned. 
General Tips for Online Teaching 
• Keep the focus on the student, not the technology. 
• Remember that not every student will have taken an online course 
before. Check understanding of platforms or software you will be using. 
• Be gentle with students who have internet accessibility issues. Some 
students are accessing the class on their phones. 
• Resist the temptation to post too many resources. It can cause sensory 
overload when students have to view many links, articles, or videos. 
• Be clear in your expectations regarding assignments, due dates, and 
policies from the start, but be flexible. Online students may be working, 
be parents, or have other responsibilities. 
• Group projects can take longer to put together for online students. 
Allow more time if needed. 
Student-Centered Learning Online  |  67
• Communication with students can be more challenging online. Be as 
clear as you can be. 
• Make yourself accessible via online office hours and regular 
communication. 
• Let your personality come through in your communications with 
students. 
• When you provide students written feedback, always send an 
announcement. Leaving students feedback online is only effective if 
they visit the page to read it! 
• Technology does not always work the way we want it to. Ask students 
to let you know if they have issues! 
• Think about whether your students have proficiency and access to 
technology, like cameras, and whether privacy issues could affect 
participation. 
Conclusion and Summary 
Online teaching does not have to be a challenge for new graduate teaching 
assistants or professors. This chapter has outlined simple ways to make 
moving a class online easier and discussed the disadvantages and advantages 
of the most popular methods in which online courses are presented. It 
also highlighted important points to consider when setting up an online 
system to support student-centered teaching. I hope that with the student-
centered tips in this chapter, you can confidently create an online course 
quickly and help keep the class’s focus on your students, not the technology.

5. Technology Makes It Easier
NASIM EBADI AND GHADIR ASADI 
Introduction 
Imagine that you have a large class full of students whom you might not 
have a chance to talk with during the semester. You want all of them to be 
engaged in the class and participate in the class activities. You might also 
find undergraduate students to be very shy about participating during class 
time. Students may be especially hesitant to answer your question while 
you are teaching new material. Or, you wish to grade the assignments faster 
and give quizzes every other session without spending so much time with 
paper collection, grading, and grade entry. You might find it a tedious task 
to reply to students’ emails about this week’s reading list, midterm date, due 
dates, and their standing so far in the semester. A well-designed technology-
integrated course might be the solution to your problems. Technology 
integration is a dynamic process of design, implementation, and evaluation.

This chapter will discuss… 
• 
The opportunities and challenges related to technology 
integration. 
• 
How to design, implement, and maintain a successful 
technology-integrated course. 
• 
Common types of technologies that can be purposefully 
integrated. 
The Motive behind Technology Integration 
Technology is the knowledge or science that helps us to solve problems 
(Webster, 2006). In this regard, technology can be defined in two ways: as 
any change in the ways of doing things or as the tools we use to do things 
more quickly and/or efficiently. For instance, some websites facilitate the 
grading process for instructors. Devices, such as smartphones and laptops, 
can be used for taking attendance and pop-up quizzes. Thus, in both 
definitions, technology can be used in the educational environment to 
facilitate the process, improve productivity, and enhance various measured 
outcomes. 
Most of our students are from generation Z (born between 1996 and 2010); 
they are “digital natives” and were born in a globally connected world. They 
are fast decision makers who tend to record instead of taking notes, are 
more interested in online examinations, and expect a lecture to “come and 
entertain me” (Cilliers, 2017). Today’s students prefer integrative games, 
collaborative projects, and challenges over lectures and discussions 
(Rothman, 2016). Additionally, quality of education has been proved to be 
Technology Makes It Easier  |  73
more important than years of education and/or degree (Asadi, 2020). Thus, 
students need to acquire the essential skill sets required for modern 
workplaces, such as critical thinking, problem-solving, ability to keep 
learning, collaboration, and digital skills (Wabisabi Learning, 2020). 
Integrating technology into the course provides a learning environment for 
students to develop their skill sets. 
Technology integration can be done on various scales, from playing a 
video in the class to shifting the course structure so that every activity 
in the class is blended with technology. Blended learning is defined as the 
instructional approach that combines traditional face-to-face instruction 
with technology-based instruction (Herold, 2016). In a blended learning 
environment, students have control over the time, place, and method of 
work (Maxwell, 2016). One might consider integrating technology into the 
course only to the extent that it improves the learning environment and 
matches our content and style. By incorporating technology into the class, 
one can employ students’ experience in the continuous use of technology to 
save time and build a more suitable framework for the materials and teaching 
style. 
Another important aspect of technology is that one can tailor it to fit the 
needs. For instance, each Learning Management System (LMS) offers a range 
of features. The instructor can integrate as many features they want into the 
course, and in some cases, by combining these features, they can develop 
new applications. In particular, using LMS, you can deliver the material 
in different forms, such as sharing videos, audio, documents, and links to 
further educational sources.In addition, by gathering immediate feedback 
from students using discussion panels or direct messages through LMS, the 
instructor can take customized action regarding the subject matter. 
Free multiplace multitime accessibility is another advantage of a 
technology-based learning environment. In many cases, technologies are 
free, or they have a free version with limited features, and contents are 
accessible in all places via the internet, at all times, and on multiple devices. 
For instance, online tutorial videos create opportunities for students to be 
self-educators and acquire new skills. Moreover, technologies can assist in 
structuring and managing large classes in many ways, such as monitoring 
attendance, administering quizzes, grading exams, assessing, summarizing 
students’ opinions, playing games, and last but not least, sharing content. 
Integrating technology is useful for instructors in several other ways, 
74  |  Technology Makes It Easier
including improving communication, collaboration, time management, and 
in the availability of instructional resources such as Open Educational 
Resources (OER) and applications. 
There are two important benefits of using technology that need to be 
highlighted: using technology to improve diversity and inclusion, and to 
design a syllabus that extensively uses technology. 
Technology Makes It Easier  |  75
Diversity 
One important feature of technology is the ability to introduce 
different delivery methods specifically designed to address the 
needs of different audiences—a powerful instrument to enhance 
diversity and inclusion. In that regard, technology can be of great 
help in increasing accessibility and providing equal opportunity for 
all students. For instance, one can caption both the lecture and 
other multimedia for access by deaf or hard of hearing people. 
Alternatively, facilitating online submission using voice recognition 
tools helps blind or partially sighted students more easily submit 
assignments. Students with anxiety have a hard time taking notes 
and following the flow of the class. Using online materials, slides, 
recording the sessions, providing audio files, and encouraging note 
sharing between students helps students with anxiety stay calm in 
the class and focus on learning. These strategies can ensure the 
student has both all the materials and the opportunity to review 
them later on. 
Another benefit of technology is helping students to pass cross-
cultural barriers. For instance, students with different cultural 
backgrounds (e.g., international students) might have difficulty 
participating in the class activities for various reasons, such as fear 
of not being understood because of speaking with an accent or a 
lack of confidence. Using technology in class helps these students 
by providing an engagement opportunity without pushing their 
comfort boundaries. Moreover, technology allows you to present 
the same materials in different formats such as text, pictures and 
graphs, audio, and video. This enables students with diverse 
learning styles and attitudes to connect themselves with the 
teaching materials through a channel that better suits them. 
76  |  Technology Makes It Easier
Syllabus Development 
A syllabus is an important first opportunity for technology to jump 
in and benefit both the instructor and the students. A 
technologically integrated syllabus has many advantages. First, it is 
easily available to students during the semester, as opposed to the 
traditional paper distribution format which most students will lose 
in the second week. Second, it is a source file for all other 
technology that you are using. For example, if you are using an 
application for taking quizzes in your classroom, or, if you require 
students to purchase an integrated account with their textbook to 
do the assignments, the syllabus is the place to provide instruction 
and hyperlinks for students to refer to. Third, with most LMS 
available on the market, you have an option for an online syllabus. 
Using that option enables you to connect all of your contents with 
the syllabus and students will be able to walk through the syllabus 
during the semester. You can link all of your slides, extra readings, 
external links, assignments, and due dates in one place. You can 
divide your syllabus into weeks, parts, or chapters, and you can set 
reminders for students regarding your class progress, such as a 
notification for assignments’ due dates. Finally, a technologically 
integrated syllabus makes your course transition much easier. You 
can easily migrate from one semester to another by a few clicks and 
by making some minor changes in due dates and links.

Technology Integration and Challenges 
Integrating technology is a broad concept that can cover many techniques 
and tools. Having technology as an integral part of the classroom is not 
a one-time effort to facilitate teaching and engagement. Technology 
integration is a dynamic process of design, implementation, and evaluation. 
However, integrating technology into the classroom is a challenging task. 
Instructors complain that using laptops or smartphones during the lecture 
increases the possibility of distraction. Moreover, technology does not 
always work correctly; we have all had this experience at least once in our 
life. Therefore, being solely dependent on technology is not a good strategy. 
Lack of technical support is another critical challenge regarding 
technology integration. Having proper technical support in terms of both 
training and maintenance is vital for technology integration. Finally, 
technology advances quickly, and keeping yourself and students updated is a 
continuous investment. Some of the technologies introduced in this chapter 
will likely change or even become obsolete over time. It is the responsibility 
of instructors to keep themselves current with technological advancements. 
In this section, each step and its associated challenges has been introduced. 
Design 
Engagement theory suggests that creating a meaningful learning 
environment requires three principles: collaborative effort, project-based 
assignments, and non-academic focus, that is,  having an outside-of-the-
classroom focus (Kearsley & Shneiderman, 1998). Technology facilitates all 
of these principles. In particular, technologies such as Google Drive and 
communication-based applications enable collaboration by easing content 
sharing and group meetings outside of the classroom. As discussed below 
under types of technology, most of the technologies support both individual 
and group communications. These technologies enable instructors to easily 
track, assess, and improve teamwork among students. Instructors can also 
help students practice solving real-world problems by using online 
resources such as free data sets or student-based industry projects. 
78  |  Technology Makes It Easier
Depending on the objectives of the instructor, she can use technology at 
different levels. Sometimes technology only helps to facilitate an old activity 
like taking a quiz or grading the exams. Instead, the instructor can design 
a new (in or outside of the class) activity or assignment by focusing on 
higher critical thinking levels. In particular, as Bloom’s technology taxonomy 
(Sneed, 2016) suggests, asking students to create new content such as by 
blogging or making a podcast is more valuable for students than merely 
playing a video during the lecture. This is mainly because creating new 
content requires high levels of critical thinking that include connecting the 
ideas and developing new ideas. The instructor can also engage students in 
the design procedure by asking their opinions on what they want to learn, 
how they want to learn, and inviting them to share any successful experience 
with a particular technology. 
Implementation 
Successful implementation of technology requires addressing several key 
aspects. The instructor needs to ensure the availability of the technology 
in use. For instance, in using a new application to facilitate students’ 
collaboration, the first step is to make sure the application is readily available 
for all students. Moreover, students might need to receive training and 
technical support from either the instructor or someone else. In particular, 
if the instructor uses a Windows (Mac) device, it is essential to make sure 
she knows how to implement the same process on a Mac (Windows) device. 
Additionally, financial constraint is one of the crucial challenges of successful 
technology adoption. To overcome financial constraints, it is better to use 
more OER and free technology. 
In addition, it is better to always have a backup strategy in case the 
technology was not available to use for any reason. For instance, having 
a pen-and-paper option or downloading online materials beforehand can 
reduce the instructor’s stress. In this regard, another consideration with 
the use of technology is that anyone can easily be caught up in using 
technologies up to the point where they forget why they started using 
it in the first place. For instance, excessive use of virtual communication 
Technology Makes It Easier  |  79
applications may cause students to lose real-world communication skills (Al-
Bataineh & Brooks, 2003). Thus, the best approach is to treat technology as a 
tool, not as an end in itself. 
Evaluation 
Evaluation of technology integration takes two different yet interrelated 
approaches. First, in a broader sense, one can measure how technology 
integration affects the achievement of learning objectives. Second, one can 
evaluate every step of the integration, including design and implementation. 
Gathering feedback from students and peers regularly is an important part 
of a successful technology-integration process. Instructors can use multiple 
sources for feedback, such as direct feedback from students, peer 
observation, and self-reflection. Feedback can be both visual or verbal. For 
instance, by using polls, discussion panels, or watching student-created 
videos, instructors can gather useful feedback from their students. 
Types of Technology 
One feature of new technologies is their flexibility and the interchangeability 
between different structures and configurations. Thus, categorizing 
technologies in the education industry is useful but not accurate. For 
instance, LMS integrate data from many different platforms with different 
capabilities, options, and uses. Here, categorization is based on the main 
instrument intended in the design of the introduced technology. In each 
case, you will receive a description of the other available types and options 
as well. Additionally, only the technologies that one might use in a class 
environment to communicate with students inside or outside of the class 
or provide materials has been discussed. We deliberately do not discuss 
other resources available for instructors that have been provided by new 
technologies like educational multimedia on YouTube and elsewhere, free 
courses with free textbooks, and other learning materials on OpenStax, 
Oasis, and Lumen. 
80  |  Technology Makes It Easier
Technology has generally been divided into three groups. Web-based 
technologies are those technologies that require you to have access to a 
personal computer, laptop, or tablet to best use the technology. Although 
these types of technologies are accessible using a smartphone, to develop 
and manage the content and communicate with the technology to use it to 
its full potential, you need to use a personal computer. The second type of 
technology is application-based technology. Although technically web-based 
technologies include application-based technologies, we define the latter 
as a technology in which instructors and students only need a smartphone 
to use the technology to its full potential. Again, in general one can use a 
personal computer to access these technologies as well, but a smartphone 
does the job best. Finally, instrument-based technology requires instructors 
and students to use an external device to use the technology. The main 
difference here is that, despite the first two types of technology, usually 
there is no need for the internet, and the device is enough for the 
communication between the instructor and students. 
Technologies can be categorized based on other characterizations as well. 
For example, in an era where higher education is very expensive, it would 
be advantageous for technology to be free or very cheap for students. Then, 
the pricing options can differentiate the technologies from each other. One 
common strategy between the developers of new technologies is to provide 
pricing options or second-degree price discrimination. By providing a range 
of services within a predefined bundle, one has a choice to choose the 
price-service correspondence. Since the pricing options are changing based 
on the competition in the market and the emergence of new rivals in the 
ever-innovative and competitive environment of technology, pricing has not 
been a source of comparison here. The existence of a free version has been 
mentioned and interested readers can follow the provided links in the list of 
references and find the current pricing options for each technology at any 
time. 
Another way of categorizing technology is to group them based on their 
use in the class environment. As it will be explained later, some technologies 
are designed to develop and manage content, some to collect students’ 
ideas and comments, some for quiz or test administration, and some for 
communication and collaboration, etc. Although it is a useful categorization, 
there are a vast number of technologies that do two or more of these 
functions simultaneously. For instance, most Learning Management Systems 
potentially can provide all the mentioned services, one way or another. In 
Technology Makes It Easier  |  81
other words, a grouping based on the usage cannot partition technologies at 
all. Here, the different services each technology provides has been discussed, 
and one can connect the dots for categorizing based on the services each 
technology offers. Table 1 summarizes the introduced technologies in this 
chapter.

Web-Based Technology 
Web-based technology is one of the most flexible technologies and it 
currently dominates the learning industry. The main advantage of this type 
of technology is its adaptability and potential to offer new services. 
Moreover, most web-based technology can host its own application-based 
technology, making it more user-friendly and accessible. Here, we introduce 
a few prominent web-based technologies to build a ground for the reader to 
choose among the list here or find one on the web. 
Learning Management System 
A Learning Management System (LMS) is an online platform in which firms 
and/or instructors can manage and organize learning materials for their 
audiences. LMS consists typically of a predefined setup that enables 
instructors to create and manage content; create and manage different types 
of assessments; and monitor, grade, and provide feedback on students’ 
progress. Moreover, an LMS provides an opportunity for collaboration and 
integration with other learning portals. All universities now have an online 
LMS for course management. From the authors’ experiences, the best 
practice in using the LMS system is three-fold. 
1. Keep your class page neat and straightforward so students can easily 
find anything they need. You can do this by creating folders, sections, 
and cross-references. 
2. Put all contents online. Students should have access to slides, 
assignments, extra readings, useful links, data sets, etc., on the LMS. 
3. Do not push it too hard. It is tempting to use all the LMS system 
capabilities, but technology integration has an optimum level. It can 
quickly get overwhelming for students to learn about different aspects 
of the technologies. Only use the part of your LMS system that makes 
you and your students’ life more manageable. 
Technology Makes It Easier  |  85
In choosing a good LMS, institutions look at the pricing, scalability of the 
platform with the size of the institution, availability of an intuitive 
customizable user interface, compatibility with plug-ins offered by external 
third-party developers, existence of a supportive community, and availability 
of a high-quality smartphone application. Here are some well-known LMS 
currently on the market. 
Canvas has a very intuitive and flexible environment with all the desirable 
features of a standard LMS system that have been mentioned. Moreover, it 
allows instructors and students to communicate instantly, lets the students 
peer review each others’ assignments, and has a discussion forum for each 
class. Although it is continuously improving, one can catch up with the 
new changes through the official website or ask questions on the Canvas 
Community. The Canvas smartphone applications, which help instructors, 
students, and even parents to have easy access to the provided materials in 
the original platform, increase the accessibility of Canvas. 
Blackboard allows you to share files with your students, contact them, and 
monitor their progress. It has many other features that are expanding over 
time. Similar to Canvas, one can get introduced to the platform, catch up 
with new features, and/or resolve issues by using the website to connect 
with the Blackboard Community. Blackboard also has smartphone 
applications. 
Moodle is also getting instructors’ attention. It is easily adapted to 
different teaching styles, contents, and fields. It has quite a few applications 
for easy access on smartphones, and more importantly, its free version 
provides a lot of options. Moodle is open-source and has a viable community 
as well. 
Google has developed its own LMS called Google Classroom. Although 
Google Classroom is in its early years, it has great potential considering its 
integration with Gmail, Google Drive, Form, Sheet, Docs, Slides, Meet, and 
Groups. It is only free for schools already using Google Apps, but due to the 
cost, it is not hard for an individual instructor to buy. 
86  |  Technology Makes It Easier
Google Components 
Using Google Classroom is not free, but other Google products and 
applications can be beneficial, and they are free of charge. Here are a few 
tips on how to use Google products in a classroom setup. Use Google Drive 
to share a folder or a file with your class. Use Forms to create a simple 
public or anonymous response or polls from your student and run a quiz in 
your class or collect your students’ comments and suggestions. Use Google 
Sheets, Docs, and Slides to share content with your students. Finally, you can 
use Google Groups to create a group for your class and use it as a tool to 
quickly access your students through email, for example. 
Tools for Assessment and Engagement 
Many students are shy about expressing their ideas in the classroom, 
especially for new content. Students are often hesitant to suggest what 
seems an “off the wall” idea or are afraid they might choose the wrong 
answer, both of which could end up embarrassing them in front of their 
classmates. Technology can help students engage with the material without 
forcing them to move away from their comfort zone. Using the assessment 
and engagement tools, students can make comments, evaluate their learning 
progress, and participate in quizzes without feeling judged or embarrassed. 
One handy technology in this category is the Poll Everywhere platform. 
With this platform, which like the other one, has a smartphone application, 
you can run polls in the class with a variety of choice types. Moreover, you 
can instantly get results and analyze them using graphs, charts, and other 
available options. It is only free for very small classes (currently the limit is 25 
students), but there is a continuum of pricing options. Other websites help 
you to create content as well as administer quizzes. Mentimeter and Padlet
have predesigned tests and content that make the instructors’ life easier. 
ExamSoft provides a platform that enables the instructor to administer tests 
easily. More importantly, it provides a detailed assessment tool instructors 
can use to evaluate learning progress, quality of the exam questions (it can 
Technology Makes It Easier  |  87
even evaluate the quality of the curriculum). The same services exist for 
students to follow their progress and find the concepts that need more 
attention. 
Video Conferencing Tools 
We are writing this book in a time when COVID-19 forced us to stay at home. 
Halfway through the spring 2020 semester, almost all universities canceled 
all physical in-person classrooms and moved online. One technology that 
enabled them to do so was video conferencing. With these technologies, 
you can experience a virtual classroom, present from your slides, use a 
blackboard, and talk with your students. Most of these technologies require 
personal computers, with smartphone applications that can support the 
essential functions. Zoom, Skype, Slack, and Join Me are among the most 
used applications for these purposes. 
Add-on 
There are plenty of add-ons that can be combined with Google and 
Microsoft products to help you conduct quizzes or collect students’ 
responses to quizzes. For example, Pear Deck can be added to Google Slides 
or Microsoft PowerPoint and by creating quizzes, adding videos and 
multimedia, and sharing notes with the students, engage the student within 
the class, or students in remote or online sessions with the materials. Other 
add-ons (e.g., Loom) are available for your browser or as a separate software 
that enables you to send videos to your students and colleagues. 
88  |  Technology Makes It Easier
Application-Based Technology 
Application-based technologies are those technologies that are best or most 
delivered by smartphone applications. Students tend to be easily distracted 
in the classroom environment, and instructors can keep them engaged with 
a variety of both content and its presentation. Improvement in 
communication technology has motivated many people to buy a 
smartphone, and no matter how much you oppose the use of smartphones 
in the class environment, you cannot deny they have made a wide variety 
of learning content and procedures available for free or nearly free. As we 
mentioned before, you can almost always use personal computers or tablets 
to access the same services as well. 
Assessment and Engagement 
Some application-based technologies can be used for assessment, playing 
games, and sharing learning content—for example, if you need to play a 
game with students, to conduct a short quiz every session, or to assign 
a challenging in-class assignment that keeps students engaged in the 
classroom. Ask your students to download Kahoot! on their phone and you 
can create multiple types of quizzes for class or assign a project for home. 
You have the option to use the predesigned games, a question bank, 
duplicate your existing course, add media contents to your course, and 
many other cool features. Kahoot!’s reporting on and analysis of students’ 
performance, as well as a student’s ability to collaborate with other Kahoot! 
users, combined with a very good content management system, give Kahoot! 
an advantage over other application-based technology. 
Top Hat is another application that instructors can use to design and 
assign exams and quiz and create homework for the class. It could also 
be integrated with the LMS systems to provide assessment feedback on 
students’ performance for the instructors which help the teacher to make 
the necessary actions based on that. Acadly, Turning Technologies, Echo360, 
Qwizdom, Ombea, Class Question, Socrative, and Arsnova provide 
alternatives to Top Hat for use in taking online attendance and administering 
quizzes. 
Technology Makes It Easier  |  89
Quizlet helps students and instructors to summarize the course for 
improving the learning process and easier review. Moreover, students can 
contribute to creating class content. Although this method’s effectiveness 
depends on the contents and student-specific learning characteristics, more 
and more content is being developed for these types of technology. 
Brainscape, Course Hero, StudyStack, and Flashcard Machine are among 
Quizlet’s rivals on the market. 
Communication 
Other applications are designed to facilitate communication, group activity, 
and sharing of content. For example, you can create a GroupMe for your 
class, and students can share notes with each other or ask simple questions 
regarding class materials or due dates. GroupMe only needs a phone number 
from each member, and like any other applications, you are instantly in 
touch with all of your students. As the system works like a group chat, not 
necessarily relying on the internet, it is a very easy and efficient method 
for your students to find peers and create a study group. Moreover, some 
of its features do not require continuous access to the internet either. For 
texting, you do not even need a smartphone. Thus, with a bare minimum of 
a phone, you have access to all of your students, and they have a continuous 
connection with each other. As a caution to readers, we encourage you 
to review your campus’ policies regarding software access to student 
information. Your campus may have restrictions on the use of this type of 
technology. 
The Band application is another useful application for connecting a group 
of people for collaboration and content sharing. Band has the feature of 
highlighting important messages by showing them at the top of the board, 
notifying members of important messages or a specific date, monitoring the 
readers (or as they phrase it, “keeping members accountable,”) and many 
other features. 
Some applications are designed to create content in multimedia format 
in the educational environment. Flipgrid, for example, was designed by 
Microsoft to create videos. There are quite a few other applications that 
can be used for communication in text, voice, and video, sharing content 
90  |  Technology Makes It Easier
in different formats, and direct calls between members, including Discord, 
Whatsapp, and Telegram, and one can find a dozen more on the internet as 
well. 
Instrument-Based Technology 
With all these smartphone applications, it seems an old idea to ask students 
to buy an extra device for class communication. However, instrument-based 
technologies are still in use, and universities support instructors in using 
these devices. One advantage of these instruments is your confidence in 
their accuracy when using them as a tool to monitor class participation. 
Iclicker 
Instructors usually use Iclicker to monitor class participation or conduct 
multiple-choice quizzes in the class. The new version of Iclicker has a 
keypad, and students can submit verbal answers as well. Moreover, 
instructors can give students the option to use smartphone applications, 
which makes the technology cheaper. 
Summary 
This chapter explains the opportunities and challenges related to technology 
integration in the classroom. Modern classrooms where the instructor and 
the students utilize new technologies are crucial. The most important 
benefits of integrating technology into the classroom include developing 
digital skills; improving learning content; incorporating various educational 
sources; 
increasing 
engagement, 
accessibility, 
and 
inclusion; 
and 
overcoming cultural barriers. However, there are many challenges, such as 
creating opportunities for distraction, lack of technical support, and drastic 
technological advancement. Successful technology integration requires a 
Technology Makes It Easier  |  91
dynamic process that mainly focuses on instruction objectives. We have 
introduced and described many technologies that can help instructors adapt 
to the new technology-integrated teaching environment; these are 
summarized in Table 5.1. In the end, each instructor needs to answer a few 
questions to determine how to use the knowledge she gathered from this 
chapter. 
Reflection Questions 
• 
How can technology help you to achieve your goals? 
• 
What kinds of technology do you want to use? 
• 
What is the appropriate level of technology integration for 
your class? 
• 
How you want to assess your technology integration at the 
end of the semester to fine tune your strategies in the future? 
• 
Answering these questions and others that can be added 
depending on the specific context, enable the instructor to 
use the technology to its fullest capability.

VIGNETTE: No really, I don’t 
have internet 
BETHANY WOLTERS 
In 2007 and 2008, Bethany was a high school senior trying to take an online 
dual enrollment course from a local college. While most people were getting 
high speed DSL internet, in the part of the county where Bethany’s family 
lived the only option was slow dialup internet even though they lived only 
an hour away from a major southeastern U.S. city. To watch the 3-4 hours of 
recorded lecture videos per week, Bethany drove to either the local library 
or a friend’s house—or waited at least 30 minutes for the video to buffer on 
her family’s slow internet. She had to wait until everyone else had gone to 
bed to try and watch the video lectures at home because at that time no one 
else was trying to use the phone or internet (and you cannot receive or make 
phone calls when using dial-up internet). On Tuesday nights, Bethany drove 
to a friend’s house across town for an hour to participate in the synchronous 
instant messenger chat discussions. Even though it was completely text-
based, the internet at her house was not fast enough for her to keep up the 
conversation. If it was not for the generosity of her friends, she would have 
needed to drop the course. 
It wasn’t until Bethany moved to college in the fall of 2008 that she realized 
how much access to fast, reliable internet made college easier. She created 
her first social media account because now it wouldn’t take 30 minutes for a 
picture to upload or 10 minutes for a page filled with pictures to load. Thanks 
to an initiative in her home county, her parents got high speed internet later

that year. She was so thankful because it meant she didn’t have to decide 
between visiting family for the weekend or getting her homework finished 
for class. 
Bethany assumed that she wouldn’t have to worry about internet access 
in the future. But ten years later she moved to the Eastern Shore of Virginia 
to do field work for her PhD at Virginia Tech. The Eastern Shore is an hour 
by car from Norfolk and Virginia Beach (closer by boat) and just a few hours 
away from Washington, D.C., but it is located on a peninsula between the 
Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. Being rural and somewhat isolated, 
neither high- speed or dial-up internet was not available where she lived on 
the Eastern Shore. Her only access, as for most of the people in the area, 
was on a smartphone. Even smartphone access was still limited, because 
she couldn’t afford an unlimited data plan on a graduate student salary. 
Other people used mobile hotspots for their internet access but paid several 
hundred dollars per month and sometimes had trouble connecting during 
bad weather. 
Fortunately, Bethany had internet access at work and other people in 
the community usually had internet access at school, work, or McDonalds. 
Bethany and other graduate students on the Eastern Shore had to stay at 
work late to get their online courses finished or download and print off 
any work they wanted to do at home. Bethany continued to take some 
online courses, despite the challenges, because it allowed her to participate 
in spring and fall research while still completing her classes. One of her 
classmates worked full time on the Eastern Shore and was working toward 
a graduate degree from the same university, seven hours away. But Bethany 
wished that her professors and the students she worked with on group 
projects understood what it was like to not have internet access after work 
hours. Some people didn’t believe her that internet access was still a problem 
in 2016. 
Bethany got a job in fall 2019 as an agriculture professor in western 
Tennessee and didn’t think much more about the problem of internet access 
until March 2020, when all of her students went home and the entire 
university pivoted to completely online learning. The day before students left 
campus, she asked them about their internet access at home. Out of sixty 
students, 6 students could not stream live videos, 16 students said it took a 
long time to upload or download large files (any lecture videos) and 11 said 
they had to leave home to access the internet. All students knew of a place 
they could go to access the internet, like a local library or school, but it might 
96  |  Vignette: No Internet
be a 30- to 60-minute drive from home and soon these locations closed 
due to pandemic lockdowns. For some students, cell phones were their best 
access to the internet but not all the Learning Management System (LMS) 
functions, like quizzes or exams, worked on mobile devices. There were a few 
students who requested to stay on campus during the lockdowns because 
they wouldn’t be able to finish their online classes from home. 
Bethany considered going to her parents’ house during parts of the 
pandemic, but she knew that internet access would be inadequate to teach 
online. Upgraded high-speed broadband internet had not reached the rural 
portion of the county where Bethany’s parents lived. They had the same 
internet speeds they got in 2008 but the rest of the internet had moved on 
and was moving faster. A lecture video that would take 1-2 minutes to upload 
at work wouldn’t even upload from her parents’ house. 
This was really frustrating to Bethany. The experience her students were 
having was exactly the same one that she had with her first online classes 
more than a decade ago. Why were the same problems happening? The fact 
is that rural and certain urban areas have been left behind in their ability to 
access the internet. 
Fortunately, Bethany had learned a thing or two about how to navigate 
online classes with limited internet access. She encouraged students to 
use the mobile versions of the LMS and other online content that worked 
well in apps. For example, YouTube videos are much easier to watch on a 
phone than videos uploaded to an LMS. However, she let her students know 
that they needed to plan ahead because it was going to be very hard to 
take quizzes using the mobile LMS app. She made all of her lecture videos 
downloadable and provided a downloadable, printable Word document with 
all of the text from pages within her LMS. Bethany intentionally set the 
assignment deadlines during the day on a weekday, when locations that 
provided free internet would be open. She let students know that she was 
willing to adjust the due dates on assignments or online exams if they knew 
they wouldn’t have internet access on certain days and several students 
used this accommodation. Bethany was really excited about using Flipgrid, a 
video-based discussion app, with one of her classes but soon discovered that 
some students didn’t have enough internet bandwidth to use the app. So, 
she had to create an asynchronous discussion board assignment for students 
who couldn’t use the app. 
Vignette: No Internet  |  97
Online classes continued in fall 2020 and spring 2021. Most students were 
adjusting well to online classes but she still came across a few unexpected 
situations. Bethany was talking with Henry, a student in one of her classes, 
and learned that Henry’s grandfather had a heart attack at the start of the 
semester and while he was recovering, could not take care of the family 
farm. Henry and his high school aged sister were splitting the farm work 
their grandfather used to do. Henry took care of the farm Wednesday night 
through Sunday morning and then returned to campus Sunday night 
through Wednesday morning. At first, he was not able to access the internet 
at home but then was able to get a free hotspot from the university for 
the semester. At the end of the semester Henry told Bethany he would 
not have been able to finish the semester without that free hotspot. Other 
issues occurred when a major snow and ice storm hit the southeast and the 
university stayed open because most people were teaching online anyway. 
But students who lost power, internet, or water during the storm had a really 
hard time keeping up with their course work. In some cases, students could 
not even let their professors know they were without internet or power 
until almost a week later. Even in an area with high-speed broadband access, 
some students might not have internet access because they could not afford 
to pay for it. 
So, what can you do to support students who might have limited internet 
access? 
1. Ask students at the beginning of the semester about their internet 
access at home, around campus, during the week, on weekends, and 
over breaks. 
2. Think about how you can make most or all of your course material 
available in an offline format. 
3. Upload or share lower resolution versions of files for faster upload and 
download times. 
4. Test out the functions available in app versions of your LMS and other 
teaching technologies. 
5. Test or ask students to test apps or programs in a slow or limited 
internet area. 
6. Be intentional about assignment due dates and times and let students 
know if due dates can be adjusted. 
7. Advocate for greater internet access for your students and the 
communities where they live.

6. Fun Fridays: Incorporating
Hands-on Learning into Lecture
Courses
BETHANY WOLTERS 
Introduction 
If you observe a traditional lecture class, it will be the teacher who is most 
physically and mentally active and engaged, not the students. In a class 
with hands-on learning, you will see students being involved in their own 
education by debating a case study in small groups or using a reference 
manual to solve a problem. Hands-on learning happens when the action that 
takes place in the classroom is done by the students rather than the teacher. 
Hands-on learning does not require physical movement, but it requires an 
active mind, similar to how a chess player will plan the next few moves 
in their head before reaching out to move their piece (Barkley, 2020). 
Laboratory, field, and studio classes use hands-on learning to teach concepts 
and develop skills, but hands-on learning can also be used in lecture courses. 
Hands-on learning in lecture classes can reinforce student learning and 
enhance the understanding of course content, and is often more interesting 
than lectures. The benefits of h ands-on learning activities i n c lass are 
greater student motivation to learn, a sense of community in the classroom, 
(often) higher grades, more student confidence while learning new things,

and development of teamwork and soft skills that they would not practice 
in a lecture (Deslauriers et al., 2019; Svincki & Mckeachie, 2014). Having 
students perform a task, practice a skill, or solve a problem prevents the 
“illusion of understanding” that can happen when listening passively to 
lectures and taking notes (Svincki & Mckeachie, 2014). As more universities 
choose to remove lab sections from applied science courses due to a lack of 
funding, space, and personnel, hands-on learning can provide the essential 
skills to help students prepare for future careers. 
This chapter about hands-on learning was written with knowledge gained 
through the first-hand experience teaching with hands-on learning. Hands-
on learning was used in an upper-level Soil Fertility class every Friday, during 
“Fun Fridays.” The only rule for Fun Fridays was no lecture. Instead, the class 
members explored soil fertility concepts and skills through workshops, case 
studies, discussions, and other activities in a traditional college classroom 
with rows of desks, blackboards, and a projector. The stories and lessons 
from the Fun Friday classes in Soil Fertility course will help you prepare for 
hands-on learning before the semester starts, facilitate effective hands-on 
lessons and highlight potential challenges with hands-on learning. 
This chapter will discuss… 
• 
The benefits of using hands-on learning in traditionally 
lecture-based courses. 
• 
How to prepare, develop, facilitate and assess hands-on 
learning. 
• 
The potential challenges of using hands-on learning in the 
classroom and how to meet those challenges. 
100  |  Fun Fridays
Preparing for Hands-On Teaching 
Preparation is even more critical for hands-on learning than it is for lecture-
based learning because once you give it to students, you’re mostly out of 
the picture. A little thought and preparation will go a long way toward 
making both the hands-on activities and your overall class successful and 
help students learn. You can prepare by identifying elements to teach 
through hands-on learning, creating lesson plans and considering 
incorporating active-learning overall course structure. 
Finding hands-on learning topics 
Students learn skills best through hands-on practice. Hands-on learning can 
also teach students about concepts and theories by showing rather than 
telling. It is all right if you are not sure exactly how you will use hands-on 
learning to teach these topics because as you start developing lesson plans 
and preparing for class, ideas and inspiration are likely to come to you. 
Lecture-based classes tend to focus on “knowing” content. To guide your 
development of hands-on learning, instead of asking yourself, “What do my 
students need to know?,” ask these questions about your course content: 
• What do I want my students to be able to do? 
• What information or tools do I think my students need to be able to 
find or use? 
• What products or performances do students need to be able to create 
and present? 
• What decisions do my students need to be able to make? 
• Are there any scenarios, simulations, or experiments that demonstrate 
the principles students need to know? 
• What are the issues or discussions in this field that my students need to 
be aware of? 
• What lessons from the history of my field can my students and I learn 
from this story? 
Fun Fridays  |  101
The answer to the first four questions will be specific tasks or activities 
that will likely be both the learning objective and that lesson’s activity. The 
last three questions can help you develop hands-on learning for topics that 
do not have immediate applications. The hands-on element comes when 
students must form their arguments, opinions or reach their own decisions 
about simulated or real situations. Story-telling elements of case studies or 
historical events can also make learning more engaging. For example, in Soil 
Fertility, students learned about urban soil contamination sources and how 
organic matter can be used to remediate soils through a case study about an 
urban community garden in a food desert (Harms et al., 2014). Combining the 
answers to these questions with learning objectives will give you the overall 
plan for your hands-on learning lesson. 
Placing hands-on learning within your course 
The second most important decision is how and when hands-on learning 
will happen in your course. This decision needs to be made early in the 
course design process because it impacts scheduling, assignments, grading, 
and course policies. You should carefully consider details like how much time 
there is for activities in each class period, the arrangement of chairs and 
tables in the room, and the number and size of student groups. 
Hands-on activity lesson planning needs to happen with the overall course 
lesson plan in mind. Will you use hands-on learning in every class period or 
once or twice a week? Will there be in-class lectures or a flipped classroom, 
with lectures or readings outside of class? In Soil Fertility, hands-on learning 
happened once a week, on Fridays. When you consider the placement of 
the activity within the semester, ensure sufficient scaffolding around hands-
on learning activities. Hands-on learning activities can reintroduce and 
reinforce content from lectures and assigned readings earlier in the week or 
can be used to introduce a concept in preparation for readings and lectures. 
In some situations, the hands-on learning activity may stand alone without 
any additional instruction, but this is rare and is not appropriate for the most 
crucial course concepts. 
How much time things will take and how much content to cover is hard to 
answer if you have never taught the material in a hands-on learning lesson. 
A general rule you can use is to assume an activity will take twice as long 
102  |  Fun Fridays
as you expect it to take. After you have taught an exercise once, you will be 
better able to gauge how much time it will take in the future. Until then, 
have a general plan for how you might shorten the activity or lesson by 
a few minutes if it is running long. You could plan an alternative ending 
activity, reduce the closing debrief section, or allow students to finish the 
remaining work at home and submit it in an alternative manner. Another 
option is to complete the activity in the next class period or provide a video, 
hand-out, or reading that allows students to learn the remaining content at 
home. You should also plan to have extra activities or content if the activity 
goes faster than expected or for students who finish more quickly than their 
classmates. Prepare about 25% additional content or activities that you don’t 
think you will realistically finish. The supplementary material is useful for 
extra practice problems or future assessments if you don’t use it in class. 
Individual self-paced activities, as opposed to group assignments, are more 
time flexible. Students who finish quickly can leave, but students who take 
more time or need more help can continue working without pressure to keep 
up. 
The way hands-on learning will be graded and how it contributes to the 
final course grade will influence how well it works. It might seem that 
grading hands-on learning will detract from the value of learning in hands-
on lessons, but it helps students buy into the experience. Emphasize the 
importance you place on hands-on learning in a context that the students 
will understand: grades. Imagine that your students are your employees, 
and you pay them in points toward their final grades in exchange for class 
activities and assignments. They will prioritize what you value, and grades 
communicate to students what you view as valuable. When calculating the 
total grade proportion from hands-on learning, consider the amount of 
in-person class time you will spend on hands-on learning, both in-class 
and out of class, and the amount of time needed for other class activities. 
Making hands-on learning worth as much or more than more traditional 
assessments communicates to students that you want this to be important in 
this class. Hands-on learning activities can be graded based on participation 
or correctness, or some combination. When hands-on learning is graded 
based on attendance and participation in hands-on activities, there are no 
grades attached to the quality or accuracy of students’ products or work. 
Grading for participation and engagement, rather than correctness, lowers 
the stakes for students uncertain about hands-on learning, allows you to give 
them more challenging activities, and often does not require as much effort 
Fun Fridays  |  103
to grade. It also lowers the stakes and provides more flexibility to you, as 
the teacher, if new hands-on lessons do not go as intended or expected. But 
you will need to use other assessments to assess their knowledge and skills. 
The other option is to grade the accuracy and quality of products created 
by students during hands-on learning. If you do this, you need to provide 
sufficient time, resources, and instruction for students to feel like they can 
be successful. Either follow the same grading criteria every week or clearly 
communicate your expectations at the start of each activity. 
Finally, think about the logistics of how hands-on learning will work in 
your specific classroom. Evaluate and decide how to use group work; use 
the chairs, table, and space within the physical classroom; and what other 
resources you will need. Hands-on learning can be done individually, in 
small groups, or in some situations as an entire class. Groups can be self-
selected or assigned, permanent or flexible, and each has pros and cons. It is 
easy to switch between individual and group work throughout the semester, 
but it is easier to form groups, in the same way, all semester long. The 
physical arrangement of your room has a significant impact on the amount 
of active learning that can happen. But don’t let traditional lecture room 
set-ups stop you from using active learning in your class. If possible, move 
the furniture or allow students to spread out throughout the entire space 
(sitting on the floor or auditorium stage, or in the aisles). You can also utilize 
virtual spaces to collaborate when a physical setting does not easily allow 
it. What technology and tools will you use in hands-on learning? Students 
can work on physical paper hand-outs and refer to reference books, or they 
could be collaboratively working on a class document and referring to web 
resources. Students need to know at the beginning of the semester and 
before each hands-on learning class, what technology they will need to bring 
to participate. 
104  |  Fun Fridays
Diversity 
Hands-on learning can be more inclusive of diverse student 
learning modes and levels of experience. However, it is not inclusive 
of students that need to be absent from classes for excused 
(student-athletes, student contents, and competitions, field trips, or 
conferences) or unexcused (illness, emergency, or choice) reasons. 
Instead of trying to replicate the in-class experience, design 
alternative activities that can be completed individually but 
incorporate some of the same hands-on elements. Examples of 
alternative hands-on assignments I used were attending guest 
lectures and seminars, designing an infographic, or writing a 
reflection of how the course connects to the conference or job 
interview. Alternative assignments can also help students who are 
not comfortable sharing their reasons for being absent. 
Writing lesson plans 
The last step in preparing to teach hands-on learning lessons is to create a 
lesson plan and design the activity. There are many ways to develop lesson 
plans, so find a template or system that works for you. Sections useful to 
include in your lesson plan are lesson learning objectives, pre-class activities 
(if applicable), list of materials needed, digital or physical resources used by 
teacher or students, activity logistics (group size and set-up, timing), activity 
introduction and closing. 
Now create hands-on learning activities. Instead of preparing a lecture 
and selecting readings, you will be making the problem or task students 
will complete and gathering or creating resources and tools for them to 
Fun Fridays  |  105
use. For a case study or topic discussion lesson, clearly define the problem, 
and collect resources that provide background and information. In a 
mathematical workshop lesson, write out the example and practice problems 
with solutions. For simulations or role-playing lessons, create realistic 
scenarios, stories, and artifacts for students to engage with as they try to 
solve the problem. To create an experiment or simulation, you need to gather 
or create the materials or data that students will manipulate during the 
activity. For both realism and to save time and effort, try to use real data or 
information and adapt it to your lesson. If actual data is not available, you can 
create it. Researchers and practitioners in the field are an invaluable source 
for scenarios, data, or examples. After you create the activity’s content, you 
need to make the hand-outs, questions, or assignments that students use 
during the activity. 
Before Getting to the Classroom 
Students are often excited about hands-on learning but apprehensive 
because they don’t know what to expect. You can help ease students’ fears 
by being clear on what they can expect to happen and your expectations 
for them during the hands-on learning classes. Try to have the first hands-
on learning lesson as soon in the semester as possible. The first hands-on 
learning lesson can be related to the class or it can be a creative problem-
solving or group project. 
For some or all hands-on learning lessons, pre-class instruction in or out 
of class might be necessary to allow enough class time to complete the 
activity. Anything that takes more than 5 minutes in a 50-minute class or 10 
minutes in a more extended class to teach to students should be completed 
before class to allow enough time for the hands-on activity. However, you 
then need to have a way to hold students accountable for completing the 
pre-class instruction. 
106  |  Fun Fridays
Syllabus Development 
Use your syllabus to communicate to students the value you place 
on hands-on learning through the course grading. If hands-on 
learning is used regularly in the course, it would not be 
inappropriate to weigh it equal to or higher than a midterm or final 
exam. 
In the Classroom 
Hands-on learning will look different in every classroom because of the 
people involved, size of the class, size and arrangement of the room, and 
length of each class period. In Soil Fertility, hands-on learning took place in 
a traditional lecture classroom on one of the three 50 minute class periods 
per week. The class time was spent with a 5- to 10-minute opening, a 20- to 
30-minute activity and a 5- to 15-minute closing. This setup might be very 
similar to what most of your classes and classrooms look like too, but you 
can extrapolate this discussion to fit your specific class format. While each 
hands-on learning lesson will look different, it helps follow a similar format 
so students know what to expect. A 50-minute class period is almost too 
little time to do a hands-on learning lesson well, and a 75-min class session 
would likely work better. 
Fun Fridays  |  107
At the beginning of class 
At the beginning of each class, you will introduce the activity and provide 
instructions. This part of the hands-on learning is the most crucial for the 
activity’s success, so ensure appropriate time. Give a short (~5 minutes) 
introduction to the subject or skills being covered in the activity and show 
how the activity connects to other course topics. Give all instructions 
verbally while also showing written instructions on the screen or in a 
handout for students. Explain all the instructions or background that are 
essential for completing the activity. For example, when doing a case study, 
provide students the text of the case and give a verbal summary of important 
points. 
Next, explain the logistics of the activity in terms as clear and precise as 
possible. Give instructions on student collaboration, group size, and group 
assignments if this has not already been established in your course. Show 
students where to find and how to use all of the resources or tools you 
provide. Explain what the goal of the activity is and how to use any 
worksheets or handouts. Let students know how much time they will have 
to complete all or parts of the activity. Last, explain to students what their 
end product should be, how it will be turned in, and how it will be graded. 
If your grading method or criteria varies from week to week, be clear about 
your expectations before they begin. It is advantageous to make sure that 
students have a copy of these instructions to refer to throughout the entire 
activity, either on the screen, or as a digital copy or a handout. Then, you 
turn them loose to do hands-on learning for themselves! 
During the hands-on activity 
The first five minutes of hands-on learning activity is the most difficult 
for the teacher because, at this point, you’ve relinquished the control. Give 
students some time and space at the beginning of the activity and while they 
are working. 
108  |  Fun Fridays
If you feel like you should be doing something, here are some things you 
can do instead of hovering over the students: 
1.
Drink your coffee, tea, or water (hydration is important but so hard
while you are talking!).
2.
Organize papers students turned in, or that you have to return to
students.
3.
Answer that urgent email/text from your advisor/student/boss/
spouse/roommate.
4.
Enjoy a few minutes to yourself.
5.
Watch the students work (without too much awkward staring), and you
can learn a lot about how they are working together, group logistics,
what parts of the project need work.
6.
Make sure you have the answer or solution to the hands-on activity
worked out and written down (if you haven’t already).
7.
Take attendance.
While giving students space to work, be aware of students who have 
questions, and be accessible. After giving students some time to get started 
on the activity, you can begin circulating through the classroom and quickly 
check in. Stop by groups or individuals and ask, “How are things going?”, 
“Have you found X yet?” or even personal questions like “How has your week 
been?” if it won’t interfere with the flow of their work too much. Sometimes 
asking if students have questions can limit the discussion between you and 
students and steer it toward problems rather than exploring interesting 
ideas. Try to learn students’ names and address them by name while 
checking in with students. Sometimes, a student or group needs a minute to 
formulate or remember a question they have to ask you, so it can help to plan 
to spend a minute or two with the group before moving to the next group. 
While checking-in with students, you will be able to identify groups who 
are struggling. Groups may be struggling with group dynamics and 
teamwork or understanding the concept or a step in the activity. One thing 
you can do is ask if they would like you to join their group for a few minutes. 
For group dynamic problems, you may propose a new division of labor or try 
to mediate any issues. Unless teamwork is one of your learning objectives, it 
is ok to allow dysfunctional groups to work individually or join other groups. 
Even if you know what the problem is and how to fix it, try to ask questions 
that will guide them to what might be causing the problem. Let the student 
Fun Fridays  |  109
run student-centered learning, so try not to get in the way. This is one of the 
hardest things to do and requires developing a comfort level with mistakes 
and inefficiencies that happen during the learning process. The goal is to get 
the group or individual to a place where they can continue working on their 
own, and you can check back in after a few minutes to make sure they’re 
making progress. 
Closing out the class 
As much as possible, stay on schedule so that you have time to debrief the 
activity and close the class. To conclude the activity, you can choose to 
review answers, collect student work, or hear reports from some or all of 
the small groups. Other options include a whole-class discussion, soliciting 
questions or feedback from students, or offering your concluding thoughts. 
Be clear about what students should have learned from the activity and what 
they will need to know for assignments and exams. If you run out of time, 
you can transfer some or all of the closing activities online or finish them in 
the next class period. 
How to rescue a disaster 
First, don’t beat yourself up about hands-on learning activities that fall apart. 
An essential part of the hands-on learning process you are encouraging 
students to be a part of involves failures or mistakes, reevaluating, and trying 
again. You probably don’t expect your students to get everything right the 
first time, so don’t be surprised when you don’t either. Students will be more 
willing to try and possibly fail if they see their teacher model learning from 
failure. Use your mistakes as a way for you to learn and grow your teaching. 
Second, don’t lie. Just tell your students the activity did not work out as 
you expected. They probably already know it didn’t work. Instead, talk with 
your students about what you hoped they would get out of the activity and 
why you made the decisions (logistical or content-related) that you did. You 
may choose to invite the students’ feedback on why something didn’t work, 
their knowledge or impressions, or their suggestions. And if possible, you can 
110  |  Fun Fridays
try to connect or tie in the results of the less than perfect hands-on learning 
activity to your topic, your class, or being a responsible citizen in the world 
and your field. 
Hands-on Lessons about Hands-on Learning 
New things are uncomfortable for everyone 
When you first start using hands-on learning, it will be awkward and 
uncomfortable for everyone. As a teacher, the first few classes and the first 
semester will be challenging for you and the students. But it will get easier. 
Here are some things you can do to ease the transition: 
1. Be positive and authentically enthusiastic about the activities. Your 
tone and attitude set the stage for the class. 
2. Start active learning early in the course and do it regularly and often. 
3. Do not accept anything less than the expectations you outlined for 
students in terms of participating and engagement. You do not have to 
be mean, but you may have to be stern for the first few weeks. If 
students sense that they can get away with not participating, their 
behaviors may continue. 
Also, remember that hands-on learning might be very different from the 
previous educational experiences of your students. While most of us 
naturally prefer to learn in a more hands-on way, a traditional education 
experience of 12+ years has conditioned students to expect to learn in less-
active ways. They may not enjoy passive learning through lectures, 
textbooks, essays, and exams, but at least they understand what to do and 
how to be successful. Students say they do not enjoy hands-on learning as 
much as lectures and incorrectly think they do not learn as much because 
hands-on learning creates feelings of frustration and discomfort as students 
are mentally challenged by the act of learning (Deslauriers et al., 2019). 
As teachers, we need to help students recognize struggle, failures, and 
challenges as an essential part of the learning process—but students, who 
Fun Fridays  |  111
are always evaluated and ranked by their grades, may be anxious about 
failure. You can ease their anxiety and help them appreciate failure as a 
part of their learning process by deemphasizing correctness in hands-on 
learning. Grading for completeness and effort or allowing time and space 
for revision are two ways to help students move through the failure stage of 
learning to the correct answers. Be very clear about how hands-on learning 
will be graded and how it contributes to the overall course grade from the 
beginning of the course. 
Let the content be the star, not the activity 
One of the easiest ways to ruin a hands-on learning activity is for the 
logistics of the activity or experiment to be more complicated than the 
concepts students are learning. This problem is best illustrated by an 
example from a Fun Friday class in Soil Fertility. To teach students how to 
solve common fertilizer calculations and develop critical thinking skills, we 
used the Send-A-Problem engagement technique from Elizabeth Barkley’s 
Student Engagement Techniques (Barkley, 2020). Calculation problems were 
printed on the outside of envelopes. The first and then the second group 
of students wrote their solution to the problem on a piece of paper and 
put it in the envelope. Then, the third group of students critically reviewed 
the two answers to the question and shared their reasoning. The Send-A-
Problem activity did not work well in the Soil Fertility class. There was not 
enough time in the 50-minute class period to demonstrate how to solve the 
math problems, explain the logistics of the activity, and complete the activity 
and concluding debrief, so students left the class feeling frustrated and 
confused. The next week, we repeated the Send-A-Problem exercise with 
a new set of questions. However, the students still struggled with learning 
how to do the calculations and the mechanics of the envelopes and pieces 
of paper. There was simply not enough time to effectively use the Send-
A-Problem activity the way it was used in Soil Fertility. The following year, 
we revised this lesson by simplifying the activity’s logistics, spending extra 
time demonstrating how to solve the calculations problems, and providing 
multiple practice problems. In the second year, students said the hands-on 
calculation activities were some of the most useful that semester. 
112  |  Fun Fridays
This principle also applies to technology. When Google sheets were used 
for the first time in a hands-on activity, students needed to spend extra 
time figuring out how to access the document and how to use it in the 
lesson before starting the exercise. It will take time for students to become 
comfortable enough with technology to use it to learn the course content 
you are trying to teach. 
Don’t give busywork. Assign work that is challenging. 
There is a perfect middle spot between assignments that are too busy, and 
students see as busywork and activities that are too difficult for students 
to attempt, let alone be confident in finishing. Hands-on learning activities 
need to be challenging, engaging, and relevant. You can give students more 
challenging activities if you are grading their work based on participation 
and completeness and discussing the answers or solutions in the debrief 
portion of the class. Activities that are engaging and relevant will not feel 
like busywork to students. Case studies and discussions on issues that do 
not have nice, neat, right answers are more challenging than worksheets. 
The difficulty level is based on the background knowledge and skills students 
bring to your class and the time, resources, and grading that you give to 
hands-on learning activities. 
Common Objections to Hands-on Learning (And What 
to Say to Them) 
Sadly, hands-on learning challenges the status quo of higher education 
teaching, even in applied science fields. So, you will likely encounter 
objections or concerns about the adoption of hands-on learning. Here are 
some of the common objections to hands-on learning and how you might 
respond. 
“We won’t be able to cover as much content.” No, you won’t. But in today’s 
digitally connected world, delivering content is not as important as teaching 
students about context, critical thinking, and application, which hands-on 
Fun Fridays  |  113
learning does very well. Hands-on learning can do a better job helping 
students understand how to use and apply information in settings similar to 
what they might face outside of the classroom. 
“It takes too long to create practical hands-on activities. I could prepare 
and lecture on twice as much content in the same amount of time.” Maybe. 
Both hands-on learning activities and good lectures take hours to develop 
the first time but are reused every year with small revisions or modifications. 
And the amount of time that goes into creating and teaching an excellent 
lecture class that engages and challenges students and helps them retain 
information is probably similar to the amount of time it takes to develop 
a good hands-on learning lesson. The difference in the amount of time it 
takes to develop hands-on learning activities likely comes from the teacher’s 
skill and comfort level with hands-on learning, compared to lecture-based 
teaching. With time and experience, it gets easier to create hands-on 
learning activities. 
“How do I know they’re learning what I want them to be learning in 
a hands-on activity?” The sarcastic answer to this is, “how do you know 
they’re learning what you want them to learn from a lecture?” Exams and 
homework often show that students do not learn what we want them to from 
lectures, readings, and other class activities. But with hands-on learning, you 
have direct evidence of what students are learning at the moment. The real 
concern behind this question likely is, “How do I design hands-on activities 
to guide students to learning what I want them to know?” and hopefully, 
resources like this book will help answer those questions. 
“Students don’t like it and won’t do it.” Students will also say they don’t 
like hands-on learning. When students in an introductory physics class were 
taught using both lecture and hands-on learning techniques, students 
overwhelmingly said they enjoyed and learned more from lectures than 
hands-on learning, despite their grades showing the opposite (Deslauriers 
et al., 2019). In the beginning, you can expect some degree of resistance 
or lack of engagement from students for hands-on learning. When facing 
resistance from students be understanding that hands-on learning might 
be uncomfortable for some students but be clear on your expectations and 
use an intervention like Deslauries et al. (2019) at the beginning of the 
semester. After a few weeks of hands-on learning, most students will be 
more comfortable with hands-on learning. 
114  |  Fun Fridays
“I don’t have the resources to do hands-on-learning.” Hands-on learning 
is a frame of mind about teaching, not a physical requirement. With a little 
bit of creativity, you can do a lot with the most limited resources. Utilize 
chairs, tables, whiteboards, computer projectors, and any basic office 
supplies you have access to. You can ask students to bring their own devices 
and use free or inexpensive digital resources. Ask colleagues or friends if you 
can borrow equipment or supplies. If you cannot demonstrate an experiment 
or activity, there are likely online videos you can show instead and then have 
students practice interpreting the results of the experiment. Inexpensive 
poster board and colored markers were all students needed for a hands-on 
activity where they learned about nutrient cycles in Soil Fertility (figure 6.1). 
Figure 6.1 Diagram of manganese nutrient cycle drawn on a poster board by two 
students during hands-on learning activity in Soil Fertility. 
“If students can learn on their own, then what is my purpose?” This is 
a question no one feels comfortable saying but some of us might relate 
to. Subject novices can get lost in the weeds, miss the context, have 
misconceptions or make mistakes, and the guidance of a teacher can 
prevent, smooth, or reduce these bumps in the learning process. More 
experienced teachers will have years of stories and experiences in their 
Fun Fridays  |  115
field to incorporate into realistic hands-on learning activities. And newer 
teachers will be able to relate to the struggles of mastering the course 
content and be able to learn along with the students. But, for teachers who 
view their value to their students only as their accumulation of knowledge 
on a subject, student-guided hands-on learning threatens their self-worth. 
Experienced teachers can create practical, challenging, and engaging hands-
on activities from their ideas, knowledge, and more expansive teaching 
practice. 
Conclusion and Next Steps 
Hands-on learning is an excellent way to engage students in the action of 
learning within a lecture classroom. When students are active participants in 
their learning, they will retain more of the information, make higher grades, 
and develop real-world skills. To use hands-on learning in your teaching, 
you need to spend time preparing before the semester and throughout the 
semester. All of your preparation, planning, and hard work will pay off when 
you can allow your students to learn and practice their course content 
in the classroom. There will be some challenges that you will face when 
you teach using hands-on learning. Still, with practice, adjustments, and 
some compassion toward yourself for failures, you can develop an effective 
teaching practice using hands-on learning. 
Here are some small steps you can take toward using hands-on learning in 
your classroom: 
1. As you teach (or learn), think about how the content you are learning 
could be taught in a more active, hands-on way. Similarly, collect ideas 
from others on how to make teaching more engaging and dynamic. 
2. Do a hands-on learning experiment in your teaching. Maybe you have 
the time and space to redesign a course to focus on hands-on learning, 
or perhaps you redesign one module or section of a course to include 
some hands-on learning activities. 
3. Remember that in hands-on learning, we expect students to make some 
mistakes or take a less efficient path to the answer, and your hands-on 
teaching experience will be the same.

Evaluation is a critical component of teaching as it allows both instructors 
and students to determine progress, proficiencies, and areas that need 
improvement. Grades are an important form of instructor feedback that 
can spark discussion between student and instructor. Instructors use grades 
in different ways and for different purposes (e.g., solely to mark student 
performance, or to encourage student reflection). Student attitudes on 
grades range from a consumeristic/transactional view (put in a certain 
amount of effort to receive a grade) to a self-improvement view (learn from 
errors). The first part of this chapter will address using grades as a form of 
feedback on student performance. The second part will focus on providing 
good feedback while grading, including clear expectations, explanations, 
offering help, accessibility, and fairness. 
Sometimes a student may appeal to their teacher to receive a higher/
better grade. A survey sent out in the fall of 2017 at Virginia Tech 
demonstrates that many students who ask for a higher grade want to 
improve their knowledge and understanding. Students surveyed also 
preferred to discuss their performance with an instructor rather than 
receive a grade change with no discussion. For this reason, instructors may 
utilize informal grade appeals as a learning opportunity in a curriculum

may cause some grade appeals, and the frequency of these appeals may be 
minimized by clearly communicating objectives and offering comprehensive 
assessment tools such as rubrics. 
This chapter will discuss… 
• 
The historical and legal background for formal grade 
appeals. 
• 
Using and encouraging informal grade appeals as learning 
tool for students to reevaluate their work. 
• 
Preventing grade appeals caused by confusion and unclear 
instructions. 
• 
Providing useful feedback through use of clear expectations, 
explanations of point deduction/accumulation, offers of help, 
and consistent feedback among all students. 
Grade Appeal Background 
Sometimes students perceive an evaluation as unfair, not representative of 
their effort, assigned with prejudice, or calculated incorrectly, and wish to 
pursue a change in the grade by appealing it to the instructor. A grade 
appeal is generally any instance where a student asks a teacher for a higher 
score on an assignment, exam, or final course grade. These appeals can be 
informal, where the student discusses the grade with the teaching assistant 
or instructor, or formal, where the requests are made at an administrative 
level. 
120  |  Grade Appeals
The formal grade appeal process varies by university. At Virginia Tech for 
example, if an undergraduate student’s discussion with the instructor does 
not resolve a grade dispute, the student can then appeal to the department 
or division head (Office of the University Registrar, Virginia Tech, 2020). 
If the dispute is not resolved at the department/division level it can be 
appealed to the college dean. Students seeking a formal grade appeal are 
encouraged to make their request as soon as possible, but no later than the 
end of the following term after the grade was assigned. University policy 
at Virginia Tech states that a professor has sole prerogative over grades 
assigned in his or her course, and that professors must assign grades based 
on established criteria rather than on students’ personal conduct. There 
is also an appeal procedure for graduate students to follow. This process 
is similar, except if the dispute is not resolved at the department level, 
then the graduate student can appeal to the Dean of the Graduate school 
with a formal statement explaining his or her reasoning (Graduate School, 
Virginia Tech, 2020). The dispute is then reviewed by a Graduate Appeals 
Committee which consists of three faculty members, one graduate student, 
and an additional faculty member who is knowledgeable in the subject area 
of the appeal. The Grade Appeals Committee may hold a formal hearing, and 
ultimately gives a recommendation to the Dean of the Graduate School to 
act on with consultation from the provost. 
In 1984, the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) 
identified teachers’ “academic freedom” as: “the freedom to research and 
publish the results; freedom in discussing the teachers’ subject matters in 
the classroom; freedom from institutional censorship when teachers speak 
as citizens.” In 1998, the AAUP stated that assessing student performance is a 
faculty responsibility (as opposed to administrative responsibility) and that it 
is part of a professor’s classroom freedom. However, the AAUP’s statements 
do not have any legal standing, so there have been court cases regarding 
whether college or university administrators may change a student’s grade 
without instructor approval. There have been several court cases that 
acknowledge a professor’s right to assign grades to students, including 
Regents of the University of Michigan v. Ewing, 474 U.S. 214 (1985), which ruled 
that dismissing a student from a medical program for failing an exam did 
not infringe on a student’s property rights; and Parate v. Isibor, 868 F.2d 821 
(6th Cir. 1989) which ruled that university professors have a First Amendment 
right to assign grades based on their professional judgment. The United 
States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled in 2001 that a grade 
Grade Appeals  |  121
change by an administrator does not violate a professor’s First Amendment 
right to free speech (Brown v. Armenti, 247 F.3d 69, 3rd Cir. 2001)). The 
6th Circuit Appeals Court stated a year later that it is a First Amendment 
violation if the administration pressures or coerces a professor to change a 
student’s grade (Yohn v. Board of Regents of the University of Michigan et al., 
2002). 
Formal grade appeals are a preventable drain on resources. Instead of 
filing appeal paperwork and hearing cases on panels, professors could be 
spending time on items in their job description (e.g. writing research grants, 
publishing research papers, developing class lesson plans, grading student 
assignments, extension work, etc.). Oslo University in Norway spent an 
estimated $300 per appeals case between 2003 and 2006, which totaled $1.2 
million (Gynnild, 2011). Therefore, it is in the best interest of both professors 
and administrators to avoid formal grade disputes when possible. 
There are resources available that help instructors avoid grading disputes. 
These resources are often tools that help students understand their grades, 
so they do not feel they received a different mark than they deserved. The 
AAUP has on its website a list of “practical suggestions” regarding student 
grades, including developing clear policies on grading standards and appeal 
procedures; applying appeal policies uniformly across students; making 
appeal policies available to students, faculty, and administrators; and 
including faculty in the same department or closely related fields on an 
appeals committee when a grade is disputed (Euben, 2001). There is a lack of 
higher education literature on grade appeals, and therefore we do not know 
how many professors consciously use tools to help prevent students from 
appealing grades. 
Not all professors view grade appeals as negative (i.e., as “disputes”). Some 
professors welcome students who evaluate their grades and present 
arguments for a higher score. Corrada (2013) explains why grade appeals 
should be encouraged in graduate-level (law school) courses and defends 
against some concerns that faculty may have about supporting student 
appeals. The author describes the method that he uses in his law school 
classes, involving a midterm exam that encourages appeals of the exam 
(instead of only offering a final exam). A midterm exam was added to the 
courses to promote student review (where a student may learn more about a 
subject from mistakes made on an exam) and ensure the grade for a student 
or class wouldn’t rely on a single grade (final exam). The author also notes 
that anecdotally, his students’ final exam grades were higher after he started 
122  |  Grade Appeals
administering a midterm exam than they were before. Corrada believes that 
students sometimes have good arguments to receive credit, and students 
sometimes deserve a better grade than they initially received. They should 
also be held accountable for any of his grading mistakes/lack of clarity. 
As noted above, Corrada (2013) addresses concerns often voiced over 
encouraging grade appeals, including (1) making extra work (teaching is less 
rewarded than publishing); (2) Flexibility of grades/challenged authority as 
a teacher; (3) a high percentage of grade changes might reflect that the 
grades are not credible. Corrada explains that grade appeals do not need to 
take up a significant amount of time. He promotes the efficiency of a grade 
appeal/formative assessment procedure by only allowing students to submit 
requests that are maximum of one page long, and are turned in within one 
week of receiving the midterm exam grades and exam key. Furthermore, 
Corrada believes that students’ benefit is more valuable than the marginal 
extra work of an appeals process. Regarding the flexibility of grades, Corrada 
explains that some grading is objective and that a professor may assign 
letter grades (A vs. D). Still, finer distinctions (A vs. A-) may sometimes be 
subjective and imprecise. Corrada does not believe that a high rate of appeals 
for his midterm exam (historically around 70%) lowers his grades’ credibility 
or challenges his authority. Many students already believe that grades are 
subjective and not perfect. Hence, an appeals process allows students to 
think critically about their answers, what they got wrong, better defend their 
answers, and question their previous assumptions (Corrada, 2013). For these 
reasons, grade appeals may translate well to undergraduate college courses 
and especially advanced courses that build upon the basic knowledge of 
subjects. 
Dealing with formal grade appeals takes time and effort away from other 
tasks on both the professor/departmental and administrative scales. It is in 
instructors’ best interests to reduce the number of formal grade appeals. 
Instructors can use informal grade appeals (the type discussed in this 
chapter) to deliver student feedback and allow for growth. Using grading as 
an intentional form of instructor feedback while maintaining transparency 
expectations and consistency among students may help in student learning 
(Corrada, 2013).

Fall 2017 Survey 
The purpose of this study, carried out in the fall of 2017, was to understand 
student attitudes on grade appeals and identify ways to minimize the 
occurrence of grade appeals (where desired by the instructor). The 
anonymous student survey was composed of 20 questions, including both 
multiple choice and short answer. The author (Emily Ott) sent the survey 
to the undergraduate listserv for the Crop and Soil Environmental Sciences 
Department (CSES), which has since been renamed the School of Plant and 
Environmental Sciences. There were 26 respondents out of approximately 
60 undergraduate students in the CSES department at the time. There was a 
potential for a response bias for “overachievers” taking the survey; however 
the responses were ambivalent that this was the case. Also, since the survey 
was anonymous and was sent out by a graduate student with both name 
recognition and good rapport with students as the instructor of a required 
course (Soils Lab), it is reasonable to assume that some students filled out the 
survey to be helpful. Overall, the survey responses—from undergraduates 
who were majoring or minoring in the department—depict student 
perceptions of grade appeals in a Crop and Soil Sciences department. Results 
are both displayed in tables and discussed below.

Half of the students surveyed have never requested a higher grade on an 
assignment, quiz, essay, or the overall course grade. The requests that were 
made were made more often on homework and in-class work. A higher 
frequency of requests on homework and in-class work makes intuitive sense 
124  |  Grade Appeals
since courses often have more graded work in the form of assignments than 
as exams or essays (i.e., there may be only a few exams and one course 
grade, versus weekly assignments). On the other hand, one might expect 
that students would be more likely to appeal more significant grades such 
as exams and the overall course grade because these grades hold more 
weight, with the assumption being that students are more concerned about 
their grades and not their understanding of the material. The results shown 
in Table 7.2 indicate that this assumption may not be accurate: Of the 
respondents, most (20/26) felt that their grades are rarely unfair, and 0 
students felt that their grades were very often unfair.

Tables 7.3-7.5 below display the responses for three questions related to 
instructor feedback. The majority of students felt that their instructors only 
provided them with detailed feedback somewhat often (17/26), and 
responded that detailed feedback causes them to appeal grades less often 
(15/26). The timing of feedback (whether students receive grades or 
feedback quickly after turning in an assignment) did not influence 
respondents’ decision to appeal a grade (15/26). These results suggest that if 
an instructor takes the time to provide detailed feedback, students may be 
more accepting of their grades.

Table 7.6 shows the results of questions about the instructor’s response to 
grade appeals. When a student asks for a higher grade or clarification on an 
assignment or exam, the instructor may respond with either an automatic 
decision or a discussion. For most students surveyed, their experience with 
appealing a grade “usually” resulted in a discussion rather than an automatic 
decision (15/26). The response to this question shows that professors already 
have discussions with students about their grades, as opposed to 
automatically deciding whether to change a grade, which is the first step 
towards incorporating grade appeals as a learning tool.

When asked about which outcome they preferred (discussion or automatic 
decision), most students said they liked to discuss the grade with the 
instructor to better understand why they were wrong. Only one student 
responded saying that they preferred a discussion because the instructor 
would not view it as a ‘handout’ or free grade change (i.e., receiving a better 
grade automatically without the student having to redo their work). Some 
example responses to the question “Do you prefer one of the results from the 
previous question—the instructor making a decision directly following your 
appeal, or a discussion about the assignment/exam and grade? Why?” are: 
• I prefer a discussion to occur. When I ask for a higher grade, it is 
because I believe I followed a rubric or answered a question correctly 
despite losing points Sometimes, it is a simple error (such as counting 
up points incorrectly). Other times, I learn that I did not understand the 
question properly and then I accept that I do not deserve those points 
OR I explain my thought process and the teacher realizes the question 
was a poor question. On the rare occasion, a teacher does not care and 
refuses to even discuss the test/paper. 
• I don’t have a preference. It depends on the circumstance. If it’s an 
obvious, difficult to refute mistake, I don’t want to discuss it (I just want 
the points). If it’s subjective, I prefer to discuss it. 
• I would prefer to have a conversation than an automatic decision. I’m at 
the point in my academic career where I want to understand exactly 
why something I did was incorrect and how to not make that mistake 
again rather than be awarded points just for asking for them. 
Grade Appeals  |  127
• Discussion because it’s normally not just me with the issue. 
• Discussion. Even a quick talk can help clear up a lot. If no feedback is 
provided, I often don’t understand what I did wrong. If feedback is 
provided, it still may be unclear to me. A quick follow-up with the TA/
professor usually clears this up immediately or with a little more work 
on my part (i.e., hear their opinions and then look at my notes). 
• I like to discuss so that I don’t seem as if I’m looking for a handout. 
• I prefer a discussion over any sort of direct results because if a grade 
gets changed that quickly, it just reiterates grade inflation and 
encourages students to learn simply for the grade rather than the 
knowledge. 
• I would prefer a discussion because then I know how the teacher feels 
and what I can work on specifically. 
• Discussion. Better clarify what I and my professor can do better in the 
future. 
• A discussion makes it easier to understand the perspective of the 
professor on how/why they graded the way they did and it gives you 
the chance to better support your case as to why asking for appeal. 
Especially if a rubric is vague or if neither a rubric or comments are 
provided. 
Tables 7.7-7.9 present the results of three questions related to rubrics and 
other assessment tools. Half of the students responded that they are less 
likely to appeal a grade when they receive tools such as rubrics. However, 
rubrics and other assessment tools were only provided “very often” for 23% 
of students (6/26), and these tools were “always” or “very often” helpful for 
only 8% (2/26). Overall, students felt that detailed rubrics and assessment 
tools resulted in them requesting a grade change less often. Based on these 
results, there seems to be room for improvement in the frequency with 
which rubrics are used in these students’ classes, and the helpfulness of the 
rubrics, in order to decrease the amount of grade appeals due to confusion.

The survey also asked students to give descriptions of their own grade 
appeal experiences. Several students responded that they felt that the 
instructor did not clearly write the assignment or that there was a mistake 
with the grade. However, many students responded that they requested a 
Grade Appeals  |  129
grade change because they wanted to understand the correct answer and 
that the instructor was very often receptive to the discussion. Selected 
responses to the question “If you’ve asked an instructor to change a grade(s) 
while at Virginia Tech, please explain your perspective of the process. 
(Thoughts upon receiving the initial grade, how the instructor responded 
when asked, thoughts about instructor response)” are: 
• Most professors are open to the process. However, the professors 
response varies. Some professors are open to acknowledging a mistake 
and change the grade (or explaining the correct answer if I legitimately 
got it wrong). Some teachers are open to discussing the situation, but 
refuse to change the grade no matter what. Rarely, professors refuse to 
look at it at all (this only happened once to me). 
• I only ask a professor to change a grade when I honestly believe what 
I’ve done is correct and that it will clearly affect my overall grade. 
Usually, I’m confused at first with why I was wrong. Sometimes written 
feedback clears this up, othertimes it does not. If I can’t understand 
why I was wrong, I feel fine approaching the professor, explaining what 
I did, and then listening to the correction. I will often push until I can 
fully understand their reasoning, though I won’t really argue for points. 
I care significantly more about understanding the problem than I do 
about the grade. 
• I’ve never asked a professor for a higher grade. 
• I felt that a couple questions on an assignment weren’t worded fairly 
and thought he should not count those ones. 
• There is a mistake when grading The adding number of each section is 
not correct. I asked the professor after class with my exam paper, and 
he checked it’s just a calculation mistake while grading. 
• They have always been respectful to my views. 
• no for grade but for an exam one of my teacher encourage us to go to 
him and explain our rational for answering problems to get more points 
back which I really liked. 
• I want to understand why my viewpoint or understanding isn’t the 
correct response. 
• I got a 89.67 I believe as a final grade and asked if he could round up so 
I’d get the A. He rounded up to a 89.7.

These responses show that students are receptive to using evaluations (i.e., 
grades) and feedback to enhance their understanding of their mistakes. 
Implications of the Survey for Teaching 
When appealing a grade, the results of the 2017 survey show that students 
prefer discussions over automatic grade changes. Because the students also 
expressed interest in learning from their errors, grade appeals can increase 
student learning. Professors may use appeals to increase student learning 
as it gives a chance for students to reevaluate their work and their thought 
processes. Grade appeals sometimes involve grading an assignment twice 
and almost always include a discussion with the student, so instructors 
should factor this into their schedule to anticipate appeals and “extra” 
grading. Providing accessible office hours to students, especially after 
returning graded work, is especially important in giving students the chance 
to appeal or discuss a grade. 
Using a Grade Appeal Procedure 
When using grade appeals as a learning tool, the instructor should have 
clear guidelines or procedures detailing the process. Policies may outline 
how students should make the request (e.g., in-person during office hours, 
through email), page length of appeal reasoning if applicable, and a deadline. 
Allowing students to write down their rationale for their original answer 
or work is a good practice in cases where they may need to defend their 
reasoning but is not always applicable. Grading is often subjective, and 
students may have good arguments or insights that the instructor did not 
consider. Implementing a clear process for requesting a grade change 
encourages the student to think critically about their work. If an instructor 
does not set a deadline, some students may attempt to appeal grades at the 
end of the semester to achieve a higher overall grade. The instructor should 
also apply the grade appeal guidelines equally and fairly among all students. 
Below is a list of items that a grade appeals policy may include. 
Grade Appeals  |  131
Syllabus Development 
• 
Procedure for a student to appeal grade (in-person 
discussion during office hours, written explanation/defense 
of answers by a student, etc.). 
• 
Date(s) on syllabus for class discussion about graded 
assignment(s) where students may ask (individually or as a 
class) for help understanding their errors. Dedicating class 
time to an informal appeal, rather than requiring the process 
to take place entirely outside of class, keeps it equitable for all 
students. 
• 
Format of the appeal. For example, will you require a new 
submission to completely replace the previously graded 
submission, or merely a written explanation/justification of 
answers marked incorrect? 
• 
Method of re-grading. There are several options. For 
example, the number of points that a student may receive 
with a submission (e.g., half of all of the points deducted 
initially), and how the process may impact the overall course 
grade; the grade of the second submission of work (e.g., 
second essay draft) may replace the grade of the first 
submission; and an incorrect exam short-answer question 
may receive half of the missed points back, etc. 
• 
Deadline for student appeal submissions (time after student 
receives feedback/grade) 
132  |  Grade Appeals
Minimizing Appeals 
Reviewing grade appeals and having discussions with students may take 
extra time, but it is likely well worth the benefit to student learning. If 
a professor wishes to minimize grade appeals, likely because too many 
requests arise from confusion, then practices such as using rubrics and clear 
feedback may help. It is important for professors to be clear about both their 
grading process and their expectations for student work before assigning 
grades. Providing detailed rubrics, answer keys, and examples of excellent 
work (such as a past student’s essay or report) can help communicate 
expectations. Multiple examples of past student work can give students a 
better understanding of the professor’s expectations. 
Students may sometimes appeal a grade because they feel that the grade 
does not reflect the effort they put into the work; some students might 
assume that putting a significant amount of time or effort into an assignment 
or project will result in a high grade. Instructors can eliminate this 
misunderstanding by making clear whether they are grading for effort or 
for understanding. (e.g., if the instructor expects a polished report that is 
detailed and formatted well, or if they are primarily looking for student 
understanding of concepts). Give students formatting guidelines or report 
templates to save them effort on the time-consuming aspects of an 
assignment if they are being graded on content only rather than on content 
and presentation quality. 
Grade appeals can be an interesting form of feedback from students on 
instructor performance. If an instructor receives more requests than 
expected, then the instructor’s expectations of students may not be 
apparent. These appeals reflect a lack of assignment clarity rather than a 
student interested in learning more. If an instructor receives fewer requests 
than expected, there may be an issue such as students not feeling 
comfortable approaching the instructor for help; office hours may conflict 
with a common course time; the appeal policy’s procedure or purpose may 
not be clear. Setting aside class time to allow students to discuss graded 
work would help students who may not have time outside of class to attend 
office hours. An alternative reason for fewer appeals/resubmissions than 
expected is that the work was not challenging enough for students, so 
students are not motivated to improve their understanding of the material. 
During the semester, the instructor may seek anonymous feedback from 
Grade Appeals  |  133
students related to the course structure and appeal procedure. The 
instructor may ask students whether the written feedback on graded work 
is helpful and what could make it more useful. Students may be confused 
by their instructor’s feedback, may not be able to read the instructor’s 
handwriting, or may not know the instructor’s feedback exists if it is deep 
within an online learning management system. An instructor may also seek 
peer feedback on rubric clarity and usefulness. 
A professor can convey expectations of student work before students 
complete an assignment, such as by providing a list of objectives at the 
beginning of the assignment. A rubric is one way to convey expectations 
for individual assignments, and is sometimes given with the assignment 
instructions or when returning graded student work. A rubric may contain 
detailed explanations of the instructor’s expectations, including examples 
of correct and incorrect answers if the instructor alternatively provides a 
rubric when returning graded assignments. Vague or generalized rubrics 
that do not provide detail and only list options on a scale (e.g., “poor” to 
“excellent”) without explanation are not useful. Detailed rubrics such as 
answer keys may be a good option for large courses where it would be time 
consuming to handwrite individual feedback for each student submission. 
Instructor Feedback 
At the very minimum, a grade marks student performance at a specific time 
on a problem or concept. An informal appeal process can instead show an 
improvement in student performance over time. During an appeal process, 
or during general grading, instructors can incorporate useful feedback into 
evaluations to improve student learning. Grading that contains feedback 
rather than just point deductions is more useful in helping students to 
understand their errors. Writing feedback can also reinforce and remind 
instructors of topics or concepts that need to be clarified for the entire 
class that they can later address in class. Useful feedback contains clear 
expectations, explanation of point deduction, explanation of point 
accumulation, offers of help, and consistent feedback among all students. 
When writing feedback on student assignments while grading, instructors 
need to explain their rationale for deducting points or giving points 
(depending on the grading style). When removing points, instructors should 
134  |  Grade Appeals
explain why the student’s answer is wrong, inaccurate, or lacking 
information. It is necessary to give feedback on how a student did not 
meet expectations. This kind of feedback can have a negative tone or be 
perceived as negative by the student, whether intentionally or not, especially 
if there is little acknowledgment of good/correct answers. To balance this, 
acknowledge areas where the student performed well, such as well-reasoned 
answers or correct answers to difficult questions. Include some positive 
feedback on performance to encourage growth. 
If a student appears to be struggling based on his or her performance, 
offer help and follow-through. If a student completely misses the point on 
an aspect of an assignment and seems to lack comprehension, the instructor 
should suggest the student attend office hours or send an email with further 
questions. The student may have misunderstood the assignment directions 
or may need help understanding what went wrong. 
Feedback should be easily accessible to students. If an instructor writes 
feedback by hand, he or she should make sure the handwriting is legible! 
If an instructor’s writing is difficult for students to read, consider typing 
feedback instead. Typing feedback to give to students is also good personal 
record-keeping; it allows the instructor to easily access and refer to previous 
feedback when discussing performance with a particular student. If a 
teacher or grader types feedback and puts it on an online learning 
management system (e.g., Canvas or Blackboard), the evaluation and 
comments should be easily accessible to students. Students may be tech-
savvy, but instructors should still let students know how to find feedback 
and graded assignments within the learning management system; consider 
providing this information on the syllabus. 
Good feedback also requires equity. Lack of equity, or grading with 
prejudice, is a valid reason for a formal grade appeal. In order to grade 
equally, the instructor should not assume that one student values feedback 
more than others and write more comments on the former student’s work. 
The instructor also should not assume that a student does not care and write 
fewer or less-detailed comments. Instructors should try to give every graded 
assignment the same amount of time/consideration. If a teacher is worried 
about favoring students or discriminating against individual students, they 
can consider having the students turn in work anonymously or semi-
anonymously. (An example of students turning in work semi-anonymously 
would be writing their name on the last page of an exam or essay rather than 
the first page.) This way, the grader can evaluate the assignment without 
Grade Appeals  |  135
first looking at names, which would lower the chance of accidental bias 
or prejudice while grading. Learning management systems may also offer a 
way for instructors to grade electronically submitted assignments without 
viewing student names. 
Conclusions 
Instructors may use informal grade appeals as one of many tools to help 
students learn in college classrooms. Especially in courses with often 
subjective content and assignments that include open-ended questions, 
essays, and exam responses, allowing and even encouraging students to 
appeal their grades can lead to a better understanding of the material. A 
survey conducted in the fall of 2017 illustrated that students overwhelmingly 
preferred their professor to have a discussion with them about a grade 
appeal rather than automatically adjusting (or deciding not to adjust) the 
grade. These students are eager to learn from their mistakes and develop 
a better understanding of the course material. On the other hand, to avoid 
grade appeals that arise from misunderstandings, instructors should use 
rubrics, answer keys, and detailed feedback to help students understand 
expectations and objectives to minimize the occurrence of this type of 
appeal. Grade appeals can be a positive element of a course and help 
students understand their mistakes, however it may require more planning 
and time by the instructor.

VIGNETTE: Does "Fairness" Get 
in the Way of Learning and 
Equity? 
LEAH HAMILTON 
My first teaching experiences were TA assignments that largely consisted 
of grading, with the occasional responsibility for creating new assignments. 
Usually, the grading for any given assignment was split between the 
instructor and either multiple TAs or me alone. Many teaching assistants 
have likely been in this kind of multiple-grader situation and are familiar 
with the rubrics, standardization, and long instructional team meetings that 
often result from concerns over “fairness” in these situations. As it’s a word I 
hear constantly in all kinds of academic meetings about course and program 
expectations, I want to investigate what we really mean when we say 
“fairness” and how a focus on so-called unfair advantages draws attention 
away from the intended outcomes of a course. Additionally, I want to present 
a few suggestions to free up the time spent litigating course administrative 
details without either being unfair or lowering the expectations for the 
course. 
In my experience, the word “fairness” is almost always invoked in tension 
with mercy or grace in situations where a student asks for some 
accommodation that could feasibly be given. It represents the idea that other 
students, having done the work in accordance with the written course policy 
and undergone any associated suffering, will be angry that “lazy” students

are getting special treatment. Fairness is invoked as the more justifiable 
of two evils whenever a student asks for an extension without a doctor’s 
note, wants a copy of the lecture notes, or sleeps through the final exam. 
I spent many hours stressing over whether individual emails fell within the 
precedent we’d set for excuses and extensions, asking for physical doctor’s 
notes and pretending I had some magic power to spot fakes, and forwarding 
students to the dean, who would certify their mental breakdown or family 
illness so I didn’t have to. The student who missed the exam dropped a letter 
grade in the class, even though it reminded me of the day I had slept through 
a final in undergrad and my professor let me make it up while he graded 
everyone else’s. It was Organic Chemistry II, which I later went on to tutor. 
I don’t know if the grace I was shown was fair. It was an unearned privilege 
in a class many students didn’t pass. I don’t know if those extra 24 hours 
would’ve made a difference for those students. But, at the same time, I was 
going to fail for missing the exam, not for lack of mastering the material—is it 
really fair, either, to penalize a student by not giving them a second chance to 
prove themself? Who, really, is being served by course policies that prioritize 
a definition of “fairness” focused mostly on deadlines and standard policies 
with built-in judgments about “real” excuses that can be accommodated if 
the student has time to document them? Who benefited from telling the 
student in Functional Foods that it wouldn’t be fair to give them a makeup 
exam without documentation of one of the acceptable excuses? 
A lot of these problems stem from a desire not to make judgment calls, 
as an instructor, about what constitutes a valid excuse or a reasonable 
accommodation. I think that’s a good instinct. Unfortunately, I think the 
policies that often follow are detrimental. Leaving the decision up to 
university policy and requiring someone to fit into an easy paperwork bucket 
or find time to meet with the appropriate offices when they’re already behind 
isn’t fair. Removing the burden of deciding from yourself is not the same 
thing as having fair policies. When I was a TA, I spent the most time litigating 
the 
course 
policies 
most 
commonly 
addressed 
by 
disability 
accommodations: assignment formats, time limits, and deadlines. It’s not 
fair to change these after the fact, but if some portion of students will 
suffer or perform worse in the class only because of policies, why not build 
flexibility into the course from the start? Is it any less arbitrary to draw the 
line at documented disabilities when the accommodation might help some 
percentage of people learn better regardless? For instance, many learning 
disabilities are less frequently diagnosed in women (Shifrer, Muller, and 
140  |  Vignette: Fairness and Equity
Callahan 2011). Requiring documentation as a prerequisite for flexibility 
means your course inherits that inequity. I’d much rather spend my time 
designing better assignments and talking with students about my areas of 
expertise than trying to grapple with such thorny questions. 
The only way I’ve found to reclaim my instructional and course planning 
time (as well as my office hours and inbox) from endless administrative 
judgement is to refocus myself on my goals as an instructor—to teach 
students the course learning objectives (CLOs) by the end of semester and 
assign grades that communicate how well they learned that material—and 
accept that any seemingly easy-to-enforce line I can draw will be challenged 
by an edge case. Linda Nilson’s Specifications Grading (2014) fits well with 
this philosophy, and since my co-instructor and I have adopted it, we’ve 
spent far less time answering endless emails about extra credit, missed 
deadlines, or points back on tests. In Specifications Grading, we tie each 
assignment directly to a learning objective, we communicate a clear goal that 
the students must meet to demonstrate their learning (and try to be flexible 
about the medium or format they use to do so), and if the students don’t meet 
the goal, then we give them substantive feedback and ask for a resubmission. 
Resubmissions allow students to improve their grade by demonstrating that 
their understanding and mastery of the material has improved instead of 
quibbling about points. Whenever there are non negotiable deadlines or we 
need to limit resubmissions for the sake of our own time, we can be clear 
with the students about why and they’re generally more understanding of 
the importance since we’ve demonstrated that we’re willing to be flexible 
where we can be. We almost never have students approaching us to argue 
a grade. Instead, they open office hours with “I wanted to know if I did 
the statistics right here” or “I wanted to make sure I understand what I did 
wrong.” 
It may seem odd to be arguing against standardization and the identical 
treatment of all students, but in my experience, it’s not actually possible 
to be perfectly logically consistent and even-handed with grading. I don’t 
think I’m alone, either, based on the number of ethical dilemmas I’ve heard 
discussed at length in teaching groups that boil down to “how can I most 
fairly enforce course policy?” Pedagogical tools that emerge from a focus on 
“fairness,” like multiple-choice tests, strict deadlines, and documentation-
focused absence policies, distract from the actual stated learning objectives 
and tie grades to how well students can work the system. Too many times, a 
seemingly sensible rubric has forced me to give a worse grade to a student 
Vignette: Fairness and Equity  |  141
whose assignment demonstrated better mastery of the material but didn’t 
precisely follow directions or wasn’t fully completed before the deadline. 
I’d much rather tell students that I need them to demonstrate a deep 
understanding by the end of the class and work with them to get there. 
In my experience, that requires a lot of flexibility and a continual focus on 
the CLOs. Sometimes, that means giving every student a second chance so 
that you don’t have to decide whether sleeping through an exam is a good-
enough excuse.

8. How to Oversee a Laboratory
Course Taught by Teaching
Assistants: Experiences in the Lab
and Field
EMILY T. OTT AND HANNAH Z. ANGEL 
Introduction 
As former graduate teaching assistants (TAs), we have ample experiences 
preparing for and teaching lab-based courses in the natural sciences. Here, 
we share strategies for teaching introductory soil science and forestry, 
which are often hands-on and require special instruction and demonstration 
by the TA. These activities involve a combination of field and laboratory work 
or are conducted entirely in one setting. 
Our goal is to share collective firsthand experiences and provide advice 
and suggestions for lead instructors, TAs, and others in similar endeavors 
to foster a respectful and inclusive learning environment and maintain 
productive relationships between educators and students. If an instructor 
is clear and consistent in their expectations for both TAs and students, 
everyone involved will enjoy a more meaningful learning experience.

Preparing for Teaching and Co-Teaching 
Laboratory Courses 
Creating Lab Activities 
As the lead instructor of a lab-based course, you may need to create new 
lab activities or alter existing activities to fit the goals and objectives of 
your course. Perhaps you want to transition to a digital learning platform 
to increase the use of open educational resources (OER), which include a 
variety of open-source information and materials for teaching and learning. 
Regardless of whether you are starting from scratch or revising pre-existing 
content, lab activities must be structured around clearly defined learning 
144  |  Oversee a Laboratory Course
objectives. The construction of learning objectives is the responsibility of 
the instructor of record, not the TAs. Additionally, it is the responsibility 
of the instructor, or an experienced TA, to help the TAs understand the 
learning objectives and utilize them in a way that reinforces the concepts 
or skills students need to learn or master. For example, as lead instructor of 
the course, ask your TAs to review what should be learned during a given 
lab session (e.g., learning objectives), explain or demonstrate how it will be 
learned (e.g., activity, task, lab procedure), and finally, evaluate the broader 
implications or importance of performing that activity or task using a group 
discussion approach. Thus, from start to finish, a productive lab session is 
structured around a set of well curated learning objectives that are put into 
practice during hands-on learning. 
The creation of lab activities and learning objectives might be daunting 
when starting from scratch. Instead of creating brand-new lesson plans, we 
recommend exploring OER to gather ideas and inspiration, particularly those 
that deal with lab-based courses in similar content areas. Here are some 
2
example OER  that may help create new lab activities or modify existing
activities, many of which emphasize agriculture and natural resource–based 
fields and may be adapted to class field trips and outdoor learning:

Our experience with digital learning platforms is exclusively with Canvas. 
However, the digital learning platform provided by a given institution should 
allow instructors to develop interactive learning content such as modules, 
discussion threads, multimedia files, and quizzes, which are some of the 
features offered via Canvas. In the fall semester of 2019, all of the pre-
existing labs for the introductory soil science lab course at Virginia Tech

(VT) were converted to online Canvas modules. This course has four indoor 
in-person labs and three outdoor field labs. During each lab week, students 
were expected to complete the weekly module, which contained all of the 
necessary lab materials and documents (e.g., learning objectives, 
expectations, preparatory videos and readings). Our rationale for creating 
these online modules was that students might benefit from having learning 
materials presented in an easy-to-access digital format in addition to the 
traditional face-to-face setting. Additionally, we felt that weekly modules 
would increase student preparedness prior to attending lab since the 
modules provided a central location for the required materials and were 
presented in a well organized and engaging fashion. For example, within 
modules, we posted supplementary readings, short videos, and images that 
depicted the topic for a given lab week. Modules also include itemized 
“before class”, “during class”, and “after class” to-do lists, setting up the 
overall lab objectives and expectations for students. The Canvas platform 
allows instructors to create short, low-stake “pre-lab” multiple choice, 
matching, or short answer quizzes within modules to help orient and 
prepare students for in-person lab activities. In our experience, providing 
concise pre-lab quizzes has been helpful for students as it gives them a sense 
of what they generally need to know before a given lab session and gives 
the TAs a sense of what topics might require more instruction. Additionally, 
online discussion boards post-lab offer an opportunity for students to reflect 
on activities and share insight and perspectives with their classmates, which 
they otherwise might not be able to do in traditional in-person settings. 
Overall, expanding a laboratory course to include some online components 
will likely enhance motivation and learning potential among students. 
Meeting Weekly 
Weekly lab meetings with the instructor and lab TA(s) are essential to a lab 
course. These meetings give TAs a chance to visit and familiarize themselves 
with field sites or understand how to conduct an indoor lab activity. Also, 
these meetings are an important opportunity for the lead instructor to 
communicate their expectations of the TAs overall roles and responsibilities 
and this should be done at the start of the semester. If the lab will be 
an indoor hands-on lab, it is the lead instructor’s responsibility to have 
146  |  Oversee a Laboratory Course
the lab activities set-up before the start of the meeting. These meetings 
typically last about two hours depending on how technical the lab is and 
may include demonstrations of experiment procedures or other activities. 
The lead instructor should practice the mechanics of the lab activities with 
the TAs instead of relying on written directions. During weekly meetings, 
ideas for improved teaching strategies may be shared and it is a good time 
to get to know your TAs and learn their strengths and weaknesses. If there 
is a lecture component to the lab course, these meetings provide a good 
opportunity for the instructor of the course to catch up with the TAs on 
where the whole class is at in terms of lecture content. These meetings also 
provide an opportunity for the instructor to remind TAs of essential tasks, 
such as how to clean up after a given lab and other housekeeping-related 
notes. 
Your lab course may not have a lead TA (e.g., experienced graduate student 
who regularly teaches the course), but if it does, you should make sure 
to be clear and consistent about your expectations of the lead TA during 
weekly meetings. In our experience, the lead TA for the soils lab course at 
VT oversees the proper functioning of the lab room for teaching, which is 
crucial since there are multiple TAs (e.g., 4-5). Some professors may expect 
the lead TA to do much of the lab set-up and clean-up for the week, as well 
as run the weekly meeting. If the instructor does not communicate clear 
expectations regarding the lead TA’s role, this will likely cause confusion 
among the other TAs. We suggest that for a given lab the lead TA reviews the 
lab procedures and activities with the TA group, while the instructor focuses 
on reviewing the learning objectives and content with the TAs. Additionally, 
as the instructor, it is a good idea to observe at least one laboratory session 
run by each of your TAs to provide constructive feedback and to gain insight 
into how labs are being taught from semester to semester. Peer observations 
among TAs (i.e., one TA evaluates another TA’s lab teaching) may be desired 
for professional development purposes or in some cases required depending 
on the department, graduate program, etc. In this case, the TA who is 
teaching will receive helpful feedback from the perspective of a fellow 
graduate student, and the TA who is observing may walk away with some 
new teaching ideas and strategies to implement. This scenario may be a 
good approach for some TAs to learn from one another without feeling 
the added pressure of being evaluated by a professor. However, other TAs 
Oversee a Laboratory Course  |  147
may not appreciate feedback from their peers. Regardless, there should be 
a respectful dialogue beforehand regarding TA preference of who conducts 
the teaching observation. 
Using TA Guides 
Supporting your TAs is an important goal of any lab-based course. One great 
way to do this is to create detailed teaching guides or “TA guides” for short. 
These should be constructed for each lab session. TA guides should provide 
thorough details of the overall lab logistics, materials, and learning topics 
to prepare the TA beyond what may be possible to cover during the ~2 
hour weekly lab meeting. For example, a TA guide will contain supplemental 
information about a given topic (e.g., sedimentary rock formation) and 
teaching suggestions to help students work through activities. In contrast, 
the weekly lab meeting is designed to run through the lab procedures and 
logistics, which should take precedence. Nonetheless, a detailed TA guide 
educates TAs on the learning topic and nuances of the lab, which is especially 
helpful for TAs who lack experience and knowledge in a given area. Some 
suggestions for what to include in a TA guide are: 
•
List of required supplies including details on what supplies each
student needs (e.g., X number of graduated cylinders per lab bench).
•
Short sections on how to “set-up” and “clean-up” the lab.
•
Organized descriptions of the flow and time sequence of all lab
activities. Some examples: students might have multiple procedures to
complete and should start the second procedure halfway through the
first to complete all on time. Also, there may be three separate lab
activities, so the lab class should be split up into groups of three
students and the activities be completed in rotations.
•
Important street addresses, directions, and maps for field-trip sites.
•
Announcements to be made (e.g., open-notes quiz next week, bring
calculator, laptop, etc.).
•
Common student mistakes or lab procedure pitfalls to avoid.
•
Supplemental information of learning content, where necessary. Note,
the required lab manual or readings for students should also be enough
background information for TAs.
148  |  Oversee a Laboratory Course
•
Teaching suggestions relevant to the given topic (e.g., special tips on
how to estimate the percentage of sand in the soil sample).
•
Suggested questions to ask students and tips for facilitating discussion
after lab completion.
•
Example calculations necessary to complete certain activities.
Overall, the TA guide’s primary purpose is to provide all TAs with clear and 
detailed instruction on how to run a given lab, including background learning 
information, procedures, examples, and acceptable answers to common 
student questions. These weekly TA guides should eliminate confusion and 
ultimately eliminate differences in teaching protocols among TAs, so that 
students will have comparable lab experiences. In other words, if one TA 
knows the lab procedure or content very well, they will be able to run a lab 
more smoothly than a TA running the system for the first time who might 
need additional help. In particular, the TA guide should have a list of supplies 
required for the lab procedure, including a list of supplies that should be 
on each student’s lab desk. A supply list in the TA guide ensures that all 
necessary supplies are accounted for by the TA at the beginning of the 
lab, promoting lab room organization and teaching efficiency. Additionally, 
the TA guide should include example problems and solutions for the more 
technical labs (e.g., chemistry based lab). It is very helpful for students if the 
TA works through these example problems with the lab class as a whole. 
Lab Assignment Grading 
Grading lab assignments, reports, or group projects is a responsibility for 
TAs in most lab-based courses and answer keys should be constructed by 
the instructor or lead TA well before the start of a given semester. Answer 
keys for lab assignments should be organized in the order of the lab’s weekly 
schedule and include detailed information on assignment answers and 
grading (point deduction, bonus points, etc.; see example at the end of 
chapter). In some cases, TAs may grade specific questions with more 
flexibility (i.e., at TA discretion) and these questions should be specified in 
the key. Further, short answer questions may receive a range of responses, 
so it is important for the instructor or lead TA to be as thorough as possible 
Oversee a Laboratory Course  |  149
when developing an answer key by adding many “possible answers.” TAs 
must use some discernment in their grading endeavors for subjective, open-
ended, and scenario-based questions. 
It is important for the lead instructor to be available for Q&A sessions 
regarding grading throughout the semester for the benefit of the TAs. 
Consider organizing group TA grading sessions, which will help TAs get a 
sense of how assignments should be graded and will increase the similarity 
in grading among lab sections. TA grading sessions are a particularly good 
idea for the first couple of graded assignments. Additionally, for lab activities 
that are project-based or require a results section for certain exercises and 
lab procedures, it is good to catalog the results of each lab section to assess 
trends over the semesters. Include a few tables of previous year’s results 
for a given lab procedure in your TA grading rubric to give TAs an idea of 
“what the data looks like” (e.g., soil texture data compiled across lab sections 
for a given semester). Keeping track of lab section results for a given lab 
procedure may be beneficial in the future as those datasets, if data are 
reasonable, can be used by students in upcoming semesters. There is an 
abbreviated example of a grading rubric at the end of this chapter. 
Learning and Teaching Environment: Laboratory 
vs. Field 
Safety 
Before the start of every semester, instructors must discuss laboratory and 
field safety guidelines with TAs. University departments should have safety 
guidelines and a chemical safety officer should be assigned to instructional 
and research laboratories. The professor or lead instructor of the course 
should clearly communicate verbally and in writing the laboratory safety 
guidelines to the TAs and others who may work in a given lab room. If you 
teach labs, you must be aware of any potential risks to yourself and your 
students. What will the protocol be if a student gets car sick on a field trip? 
Or a student cuts themself on broken glass? How should the TA respond 
if a student refuses to wear closed-toe shoes in the lab or field or simply 
150  |  Oversee a Laboratory Course
forgets? As the instructor, prepare your TAs by reviewing possible scenarios 
with them, in addition to pointing out safety equipment (e.g., first aid kit, 
chemical shower), exits, emergency contacts, safety protocols, and proper 
disposal of solid and liquid wastes. 
Before the beginning of the semester, the lead instructor must write safety 
protocols and make them accessible to the TAs responsible for conducting 
labs. In your safety procedures, include specific guidelines for following 
safety protocols so that all TAs can similarly inform students of these 
protocols. For example, if a student comes to the lab wearing sandals without 
safety protocols in place, one TA might send the student home, and a 
different TA might not notice the footwear, or if they do, they may not realize 
that it is a safety concern. Some of your safety protocols may be left up to 
your best professional judgment, whereas some protocols are set forth by 
the university or the Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA). 
A chemical safety officer may inspect your lab at any time, so it is best 
practice to enforce safety guidelines at all times to avoid paying fines from 
local or state OSHA boards due to safety violations. Suppose a given week’s 
lab procedure includes relatively safe activities such as viewing topographic 
maps or laptop work. In that case, a chemical safety officer might still require 
students to wear shoes if there are chemicals stored in the lab room. To 
prevent a student from missing a lab because of forgetting safety equipment, 
you may consider providing personal protective equipment (e.g., lab aprons, 
goggles, plastic gloves) for students utilizing the lab room. 
Lab rooms should always be stocked with the necessary safety equipment 
and supplies, but what about field trips? Suppose your lab class goes on 
field trips or conducts labs outdoors. In that case, you can prepare for this 
by going through safety scenarios and protocols with your TAs before labs 
start and make sure they are aware of how to access supplies or assistance if 
needed (e.g., in case of vehicle trouble). If your lab includes driving field trips, 
give the TAs first aid kits to keep in the vehicle. Outdoor dangers range from 
minor bruises, cuts, insect bites and stings, to more significant concerns 
such as venomous snake bites and personal health issues (e.g., dizziness, 
fainting, and seizure). 
Oversee a Laboratory Course  |  151
If your outdoor field trip requires extensive hiking in the woods, you may 
want to give students a list of supplies they are responsible for bringing and 
wearing, such as: 
•
Boots or sturdy closed-toed shoes, ideally waterproof and snake-proof
•
Long pants, ideally tucked into socks or boots
•
Bug spray
•
Sunscreen
•
Poison ivy soap
•
Epinephrine pen for students who are allergic to bee stings
•
Rain jacket
•
Warm layers for cold weather
•
Fully stocked first aid kit for both indoor and outdoor settings
Supplies 
As the instructor of record for a lab course, it is important to keep an 
inventory of the supplies for lab activities. Lab supplies might include 
materials for lab activities (e.g., soil, rock, plant samples), glassware, paper 
towels, weighing tins, chemical reagents, chalk, dry erase markers, and other 
items. As the instructor, you may have a more experienced “lead” TA who, 
based on the nature of their teaching assistantship, is appointed to work 
closely with you to efficiently run a given lab course. Lead TAs generally have 
taught the lab course before and have more experience in the course topic. 
As the instructor, you should advise the lead TA to create a checklist of the 
lab supplies well before the semester begins to allow enough time for order 
placement and shipping. If you do not have a lead TA, this responsibility falls 
on you as the instructor. 
One way to manage the supply inventory is to create an Excel spreadsheet 
organized by lab activity and date. For each lab or group of similar labs 
(e.g., all field labs or all chemical labs), a detailed list of supplies should be 
included, as well as a marking system to indicate whether an item is missing, 
broken, out of stock, etc. Additionally, it will be helpful to provide brief notes 
on the volume of supplies as well as the quality (i.e., indicating wear and 
tear) of equipment and other classroom resources.  It is a good idea to create 
and provide a working template that can be used by all responsible parties 
152  |  Oversee a Laboratory Course
(e.g., instructor, lead TA) and can easily be reused and updated in subsequent 
semesters. Advise the lead TA to update the spreadsheet weekly and then 
submit it to you, the instructor, before the close of a given semester. Keeping 
an inventory of supplies on a weekly basis each semester will help reduce the 
likelihood of forgetting to order essential supplies before the next semester 
starts. Keeping an inventory of supplies is an excellent way to help manage 
your time as the lead TA or instructor since one of your responsibilities is 
ensuring that labs are “ready to go.” 
Setting Expectations 
As the instructor, creating a detailed lab safety guidelines document and 
having the TAs review it with students at the beginning of the semester 
creates an opportunity to set the tone for classroom expectations. In these 
guidelines, it is a good idea to include a brief paragraph on acceptable lab 
room behaviors. For example, one expectation might be that students must 
complete hands-on lab activities in groups, while all graded assignments 
must be completed individually. As the instructor, you will have acquired 
many years of prior teaching experience and you will have an opportunity 
to share your teaching tips and advice with your TAs during the weekly 
meetings. For example, your TAs might be hesitant to show any sort of 
authority when delivering laboratory expectations and safety guidelines. As 
the instructor, you should help motivate and inspire your TAs by sharing a 
real-life example of how you navigated a position of authority in front of 
students while maintaining a welcoming and respectful atmosphere. In our 
personal experiences as TAs, we discovered that the first few interactions 
with students are essential in establishing how they will perceive their TA for 
the remainder of the semester. Thus, we recommend that TAs be careful not 
to appear overly authoritative and strict at first, but also to avoid appearing 
too “laid back,” which might encourage students to “walk all over you.” In 
many ways, teaching is a balancing act. 
During lab instruction, the TA might consider taking time at the start of 
the semester to meet and greet their students and allow them to get to 
know their classmates by using a short icebreaker activity. This icebreaker 
approach makes it easier to transition into the mechanics of the course, such 
as reviewing the safety guidelines and student classroom expectations. Also, 
Oversee a Laboratory Course  |  153
TAs should remind students that the ball is in their court; in other words, 
if everyone follows the safety guidelines, the lab and field experience will 
run smoothly and there will be more time for discussion, sharing stories, 
and capturing the fun and essence of each lab activity. Further, the use 
of TA guides, as discussed above, will also help prepare TAs for setting 
the proper tone and expectations for successful lab teaching. TA guides 
should contain reminders of essential points to make during the lab about 
safety or protocol, such as deliberately asking students to put on their seat 
belts during off-campus field trips. The best way to ensure that students 
follow safety procedures is to model good behavior as the TA. An example 
of modeling behavior in the presence of students is dressing appropriately 
for the field and dressing professionally when teaching indoors. For example, 
wearing long pants and sleeves may be uncomfortable in the hot months 
of late summer and early fall, but it is quite practical for field work since 
it protects against poison ivy, sunburn, insect bites, etc. Your students will 
be more likely to engage in good outdoor safety practices if they see their 
professor and TAs following them as well. For some students, your lab might 
be their first outdoor lab experience, so it is up to you and your TAs to let 
them know what to expect beforehand. 
Preparing to Teach Indoors vs. Outdoors 
Educating students has unique challenges both inside and outside of the 
classroom. For either situation, it is essential to familiarize yourself with 
your classroom or field surroundings. If you as the instructor or TA will be 
teaching in the laboratory, make sure to understand all of the features of the 
room before you start your first class. Once you review the safety protocols 
and general layout of the lab room, prepare for each lab by familiarizing 
yourself with the logistics of a given lab activity. If you are the lead 
instructor, walk your TAs through each lab’s logistics during the weekly 
meetings as discussed earlier. For example, provide your TAs with tips and 
advice on how and where to begin the lab, the order of the lab activities, 
and how to end the class with a wrap-up discussion and summary. Before 
each lab, the TAs should have thoroughly reviewed the TA guides. If a TA is 
less experienced, you as the instructor may advise him or her to practice 
teaching some of the topics or lab procedure logistics in the lab room 
154  |  Oversee a Laboratory Course
beforehand to get a feel of the space and the technology to be utilized. 
While your teaching style is unique to your personality and preferences, lab 
teaching is less flexible and subjective since you will need to stay on schedule 
and conduct activities using a specific “order of operations,” so to speak. As 
the TA, it is necessary to practice the lab logistics and review key points 
beforehand, get to the lab room early on the day of your lab session, and 
be concise and organized during overall lab instruction. Time management 
is particularly important in the lab room since it helps the instructor better 
adapt to unexpected changes that may arise, such as lab activities taking 
longer than anticipated. 
You have several additional considerations in the field, such as weather 
and vehicle use, if the field lab is off-campus. The TA guides should have 
detailed instructions on vehicle use, from pick-up and drop-off to parking 
advice, and important contacts for emergencies. Time management is also 
essential during field trips, especially those off-campus, requiring you to 
factor in driving time, heavy traffic hours, and how long you should take at 
each stop, as there is typically more than one area to visit. For the benefit 
of TAs, it is essential to conduct a dry run of the field trip to help locate and 
become acquainted with the area. For the students’ benefit, it is a good idea 
for each TA to briefly discuss the nature and objective of the lab and field-
specific safety guidelines before departing the building. Framing the heart 
of the lab will help students better understand their expectations. Also, the 
beginning of the lab may be an opportunity for TAs to instill excitement and 
pose to students one or more questions about the topic of the day. Once 
in the field, it is helpful to give students interesting facts and background 
information about the site location and reiterate the lab’s key objectives. As 
you would normally do in the lab room, frequently check in on the individuals 
or groups of students and try to do so in a way that avoids favoritism. It 
is always a good idea to have a list of questions ready to ask students to 
help keep them focused on the purpose of the lab. Encourage students to 
take pictures and notes for future reference. One important consideration 
is to project your speaking voice in the field, as there are usually more 
distractions in an outdoor environment. To boost confidence, prepare for 
your field-based lab in an outdoor setting if you are not accustomed to 
teaching outside.

Setting Up and Maintaining Productive Lab 
Room Dynamics 
Undergraduate vs. Graduate TAs 
Teaching, even for a single semester, is a valuable experience for graduate 
and undergraduate students. Departments often require graduate students 
to teach one semester, including responsibilities that range from grading 
a few exams to overseeing a course. Sometimes these same teaching 
opportunities are offered to undergraduate students. Assistant teaching as 
a student, whether at the graduate or undergraduate level, is a great way 
to build a resume and gain first-hand professional experience teaching in 
higher education. When setting up a new course, or taking over the teaching 
responsibilities of an existing class, consider how you as the instructor will 
enlist the assistance of one or more TAs. Will these TAs be graduate students, 
undergraduate students, or a combination of both? Table 8.1 summarizes a 
few critical differences between undergraduate and graduate student TAs. 
Table 8.1 Some observed differences between undergraduate and graduate TAs. 
Undergraduate TAs 
Graduate TAs 
Unethical for undergraduates to grade 
the work of peers. 
Able to grade undergraduate work, but 
may be unable to grade work of fellow 
graduate students. 
Close in age to students. 
Likely a few years older than students. 
May be friends with students or know 
them personally. 
Likely not close to students, but may 
have had one or two classes with a few. 
They have taken the course recently, 
usually in the past 1-2 years. 
Possibly has not taken the course to be 
taught or lacks experience in the course 
topic. 
May not be allowed or trusted to 
supervise students alone. 
Can supervise students. 
May not be allowed to drive school 
vehicles for a field trip. 
Can drive school vehicles for field trips. 
Your department or university may have certain stipulations in place 
regarding TAs. For example, it is likely that undergraduate students at your 
university are not allowed to grade the work of their peers. Another possible 
156  |  Oversee a Laboratory Course
concern is that undergraduate TAs are often not allowed to drive school 
vehicles, although this is department- and university-specific. Not having 
enough drivers for field trips might lead to the need for volunteer staff and 
graduate students to help. You may work at a small college with no graduate 
students at all, so the only students eligible to be TAs are undergraduates. 
On the other hand, your department may need to find more teaching 
assignment positions for graduate students with assistantships, and you may 
only have the option of having graduate TAs. 
The Student Age Gap 
The gap in age and experience between a professor and their students 
widens every semester; with each passing year, the professor gains more 
knowledge by attending conferences, conducting research, and giving talks 
on their area of expertise. With each passing semester, the students’ 
experiences in and out of the classroom have changed. It is essential to 
recognize the impact of these differences in age, experience, and culture 
and adapt your teaching accordingly so that all students feel like they are on 
the same base-level understanding of the course material and feel included 
in the conversation. The age gap is usually smaller between students and 
TAs than between students and professors, and may even be zero between 
an undergraduate TA and undergraduate students. The smaller difference in 
age between TAs and students can be helpful. For example, if the professor 
is having difficulty connecting with the students, they can ask for input 
from the TA, who may better relate to the students. If there is a small age 
gap between the students and TA, the students may feel more comfortable 
going to their TA with issues than to their professor who might appear much 
older and too far removed from his or her own undergraduate experience. 
On the other hand, a TA might be very close in age with the students and 
may unintentionally become too friendly in a way that compromises their 
professional image as an educator. If either a professor or a TA becomes 
too familiar with one or more of the students, it may be difficult to remain 
unbiased and objective while  grading. The instructor should give guidance 
to TAs on how to maintain a professional relationship with students, for 
example, by limiting socializing outside of class time for the duration of the 
Oversee a Laboratory Course  |  157
course. Undergraduates who are potential  TAs may even know students in 
the class personally and should be discouraged from becoming TAs until they 
are less likely to have their friends as students. 
Considerations for Assigning TAs to Lab Sections 
It would be inaccurate for us to make broad generalizations about 
undergraduate students versus graduate students. Undergraduate students 
can be ”traditional” (aged 18–22) or ”non-traditional.“ Likewise, graduate 
students may have recently completed their undergraduate or master’s 
degree, or they may be continuing their education after being in the 
workforce for years in the same or a similar field. Thus, experience and 
age levels may differ quite a bit. However, the roles and responsibilities 
of undergraduate and graduate students are easier to generalize. 
Undergraduate students typically take several courses in one semester, with 
14–20 credit hours per week of coursework before factoring in homework 
assignments and class projects. Many students have a part-time or full-
time job on top of their schoolwork. With these additional responsibilities, 
it is crucial to determine how much time you would require from an 
undergraduate TA and whether the time required to be an undergraduate TA 
would realistically fit into their weekly schedule. Ideally, an undergraduate 
TA would be either paid as a student worker or given independent study 
course credit, but this is not always possible, so be sure to check with 
your department. In contrast, graduate students often have assistantship 
contracts that factor in their time as TAs, so be sure to work with your 
department’s Graduate Program Director or other person who works 
directly with graduate student contracts and the assignment of TAs. 
Depending on the student and their contract, there may be only 10–20 hours 
of teaching assigned per week. All of these details must be understood well 
before TAs are assigned to lab sections and certainly before the semester 
starts, as some students may only be able to teach one lab section based on 
their semester course load or graduate contract. Additionally, undergraduate 
students (due to their class schedule and experience level with the course 
material) will likely need to serve as a “lab assistant” who is paid hourly to 
help with laboratory set-up, clean-up and some in-lab activities under the 
supervision of a graduate TA. 
158  |  Oversee a Laboratory Course
Hiring an Undergraduate TA 
A great way for the lead instructor to recruit undergraduate TAs is to treat 
the situation as a job that includes a job posting and an interview. Posting a 
job announcement may also be an effective way of choosing a graduate TA, 
although departmental procedures on TA assignments may not give you as 
much flexibility. The instructor may title the job posting as “undergraduate 
TA position”, unless  independent study course credit is offered in lieu of a 
paid hourly position. Creating this posting will allow you to consider and 
outline your expectations for the undergraduate TA. Your undergraduate TA 
will have an understanding of their role and responsibilities. A job posting 
with defined expectations for the TA position is useful even if there is only 
one student who will apply because it defines your expectations clearly, 
which is crucial in managing any professional relationship. We also suggest 
that you do not show favoritism and automatically grant a TA position to 
the ”best” student in the previous class. Great TAs are not necessarily the 
students who made no mistakes on their work or were persistent in asking 
questions during class. A great TA will be able to communicate the material 
effectively to help students understand and learn. We suggest that you set 
up an interview with your prospective undergraduate TA to get to know him 
or her a little better and gauge whether they would make a good TA for your 
lab. Here are some questions that you might want to consider when selecting 
an undergraduate student to fill a TA position: 
•
Does this student know their potential students very well? The
student might be classmates with lab students in another course. An
obvious conflict of interest arises if the student is friends with students
in the class.
•
How was this student’s performance in the course when they took it?
A good TA does not necessarily need to have received A+ grades in the
course previously, but their previous coursework should show a level of
understanding that would allow them to be able to explain concepts to
other students. Attending pre-lab meetings and going over the
professor’s lab content helps reinforce the student’s subject knowledge.
•
Is the student interested in teaching, or would they prefer to perform
other tasks? For example, the student may be interested in  instructing
in-lab, or they may rather help with other tasks such as grading
Oversee a Laboratory Course  |  159
assignments, helping design activities, setting up, and cleaning up. 
•
Is this student calm and confident, energetic, mature? Maturity is an
important quality for a TA. A TA should be prepared to assist and lead
students if something goes wrong such as a fire, a chemical spill or
burn, a student injury, a student health issue in the field, extreme
weather in the field, etc. The TA should know about lab safety in
addition to the course material. If the student seems too excitable or
immature, they may not be ready to be a TA or may need extra
guidance from you to teach and lead peers.
•
Is the opportunity to be an undergraduate TA limited to one student
per lab section?
•
Has the opportunity been announced fairly so that all interested
students may pursue the opportunity?
•
Why does the student want to help teach? Is there a genuine interest
in assisting other students in learning?
•
How much effort are you willing to invest in teaching an
undergraduate how to teach? If you only want an undergraduate TA to
assist with grading and do not expect to mentor the student on their
teaching, then maybe having an undergraduate TA is not a good idea.
Enlisting the help of an undergraduate TA will not necessarily lighten
your teaching load. If anything, it might require more time! You might
have a graduate TA who you trust to mentor an undergraduate student
on teaching, granting the graduate student a unique opportunity.
Additionally, having your graduate TA train and mentor the
undergraduate TA gives you less responsibility and work so that you
have time to focus on other more pressing tasks.
Additionally, you as the instructor may assume that an undergraduate 
student only wants to be a TA as a resume-filler or to simply have an 
on-campus job, without caring much about gaining hands-on teaching 
experience. You may be right, as students and young professionals are 
constantly faced with the pressure to have impressive resumes of 
extracurriculars and job experience. If multiple students express an interest 
in a TA position, each student’s reason for that interest may be more critical 
to address than the student’s grade and performance in the class and we 
recommend that you directly ask the student, “why are you interested in this 
position?” during your interview. Put another way, a student who received 
an A+ in the class may not be invested in teaching versus a student who 
160  |  Oversee a Laboratory Course
received a lower grade and does express an explicit interest in teaching. 
Good teaching does not come solely from expertise in a field but rather from 
an interest in communication and self-improvement. 
Establishing an Atmosphere of Respect 
Academia is undoubtedly a place of hierarchies. In certain areas of academia, 
the hierarchy and roles may be well established (i.e., tenured professors, 
adjunct professors, etc.). Still, it is up to you as the lead instructor to 
establish your personal ”chain-of-command” to set clear expectations that 
foster respect in the lab room. It is essential to communicate these 
expectations to your TAs and students as they may be much different from 
the expectations of other professors’. In this section, we will introduce some 
questions to consider before the semester begins. 
Do you want your TAs to call you by your first name or Dr. [Surname]? 
Do you expect them to refer to you as only Dr. [Surname] in front of 
students, or is it okay for them to refer to you more casually? 
These two questions form the basis of your (instructor) relationship with 
your TAs and students. Your answer to these questions likely will depend on 
how you view your TAs—as young professionals who are capable of managing 
a lab section or as your subordinate and surrogate teacher. As the instructor, 
are you going to manage down to your TAs or are you going to work with 
them? Would you like to be referred to as Dr. [Surname] in front of students 
to reinforce your authority as someone who holds a doctoral degree and 
is an expert in your field? How will your TAs address you in the presence 
of students? One consideration is that students may appreciate that the 
relationship between the professor and TA is different than the relationship 
between the professor and student. Depending on how you view the 
graduate TA role, we find that allowing graduate TAs to refer to the course 
professor in a casual way helps the students view the TA with greater 
authority and respect. Establishing a closer relationship between the TA 
and the course instructor is preferred, particularly if the TA oversees one 
or more lab sections or is at the stage in their program where they are 
considered a Ph.D. Candidate. 
Oversee a Laboratory Course  |  161
How much grading responsibility does each TA have, and how much does 
it affect students’ grades? 
As the instructor, your TAs could oversee a lab section and supervise 
students without your supervision, or your TAs may just help with grading 
behind the scenes. Maybe the role of your TA is to assist during labs with 
no grading involved. The more TAs are involved with grading student work, 
the more critical it is to foster a respectful relationship between TAs and 
students. As discussed earlier, verbally communicate your expectations to 
your TAs during the first couple of in-person meetings at the beginning 
of the semester to be sure that everyone is clear and comfortable with 
their roles and responsibilities. Additionally, it is a good idea to develop a 
“Lab Management Plan” written document before the semester begins. This 
document is different from the weekly TA guides because it does not focus 
on how to effectively run one specific lab session, but rather it serves as 
a set of best practices that the TAs can utilize for all labs throughout the 
semester. In other words, the lab management plan is a comprehensive guide 
that helps TAs in the lab course be more confident and successful in their 
instruction given the unique nature and nuances of the course. This lab 
document should be adapted to your specific lab course and might include 
the following sections: lab course overview, student-teacher responsibilities, 
communication, learning assessment, time management, accountability, 
attitude of teacher-classroom, and enforcing lab safety guidelines. These 
sections would ideally provide details on the roles, responsibilities, and 
expectations of TAs to avoid misunderstanding and confusion as the 
semester progresses. 
How well do you know the course material? Do any of the TAs know the 
content better? 
As an educator, whether an associate professor or graduate TA, no one 
expects you to know everything. You may even want to emphasize this 
to your students at the beginning of the semester. The course that you 
are assigned to teach might include some of the fields you are an expert 
in and some content from fields outside of your expertise. Even as the 
course instructor, you might encounter students or other TAs who are more 
knowledgeable in a particular area. One way to handle a lack of knowledge 
during your teaching experience is to simply acknowledge your level of 
understanding of a specific topic to the students or other TAs. Expressing 
humility and learning from others despite being the authority figure in the 
classroom is a productive way to foster a collaborative learning environment 
162  |  Oversee a Laboratory Course
among the instructional team and students. Students can often tell when 
their professor does not know the content they are teaching, so you cannot 
”save face” by pretending to know better than you do. As the instructor, 
expressing humility where necessary, showing respect for your TAs, and 
modelling professionalism is a simple way for students to gain your respect. 
Attending a Lab Section Respectfully and Productively 
This section addresses how to foster an atmosphere of respect when present 
and involved in lab sections taught by TAs. Not being cognizant of this 
particular topic may be detrimental to student learning and compromise 
professional relationships. As a professor, you have every right to attend or 
sit-in on the lab sections in your course; however, we encourage you not to 
underestimate the importance of attending lab sections respectfully. At the 
beginning of the semester, and possibly before the semester starts, if this is 
the first time you are teaching your course, think about how and why you 
might attend lab sections. For example, some professors teach lab sections 
themselves, and have TAs in the lab to assist students with procedures. 
Table 8.2 summarizes a few lab teaching scenarios and how they relate 
to the professor attending lab sections. The bulk of this chapter (and our 
experience) deals with Scenario B, but we would like to present Scenarios 
A and C as additional options as there are different levels of instructor 
involvement in a university lab course.

If you as the instructor have TA-led labs you should establish with your TAs 
at the beginning of the semester whether you will attend a lab section, and 
if so, on which specific date(s). Visiting a given lab section can take many 
respectful forms, from poking your head into the room to quietly sitting in 
for the entirety of the lab class. You should also estimate how often you 
will attend (e.g., the first few lab sections, a couple of times throughout 
the semester), and stick to your word. Do not make any surprise visits, and 
do not create a promise of attending without following through. If it is the 
TA’s first-time teaching, they may already be nervous speaking in front of 
students and might be slightly more at ease without you watching, which 
may improve their teaching performance. Consider what type of presence 
you would like to have when visiting a given lab section (e.g., passive 
approach versus a more hands-on and vocal approach) and communicate 
this to your TAs. You may even ask your TAs what they prefer. Regardless, 
we recommend that the instructor discuss with their TAs the reasons why 
they may want to attend one or more lab sections to help alleviate any nerves 
associated with teaching for the first time under supervision. 
Further, If you (instructor) have more than one TA and lab section, you 
should attend all sections equally. If there is a lab section at a certain time 
that you cannot attend, you should consider not attending other lab sections 
for consistency among the TAs. Another option is to ask another professor 
164  |  Oversee a Laboratory Course
or graduate TA to observe that section if your goal is to conduct a formal 
teaching observation for all of your TAs. Consider how your presence in the 
lab might be a distraction to the TA and students and might give one lab 
section an advantage if you are never present to observe due to a conflict 
in schedule. Instead of attending the lab sections, we suggest that you make 
yourself available during the lab times and let your TAs know you will be 
available if they need any assistance. Hopefully, your office will be close to 
the lab room, but if not, you can let the TAs know that they can send you 
a quick email or text message if they need your help. It may be convenient 
for you to attend a specific lab section more than others, but attending 
one class more often can make the TA feel uneasy. Even if it is the only 
section that fits into your schedule, and the TA knows this, it can still feel 
like you are giving the TA more attention than the other TAs, which may 
be unhelpful or perceived negatively (if, for example, you are correcting the 
TA after a mistake, answering student questions before the TA can respond, 
etc.). Overall, it is important to set fair and equal boundaries among your TAs 
to cultivate respect. 
When you as the instructor attend your TA’s lab section, you should 
establish with your TA what you plan to do during the lab. When you attend 
the lab section, will you arrive at the start of the lab? Or will you visit partway 
through? Do you want to observe quietly, or do you want to help your TA 
if they are unclear when instructing students on the lab procedure? Do you 
simply want to be there for assistance, such as answering student questions? 
One way to respectfully attend the lab section is to be there when the lab 
session starts, introduce yourself, introduce the TA, verbally ”hand over” the 
lab to the TA, and then either sit down or leave the room. Letting your TA 
know how you will use their lab time will allow them to plan accordingly. 
Another consideration as the instructor is that if you interfere during any of 
the lab instructions, this might frustrate and “throw off” the TA, negatively 
impacting their teaching performance. On the other hand, if you quietly sit 
in the back of the room to observe, you can get a good idea of how the 
students handle the lab procedures and what kind of feedback might be 
useful to the TA. As mentioned earlier, it is a good idea to ask your TAs if they 
prefer when and how you visit and observe their lab sections. Regardless, it is 
important to set these sorts of expectations ahead of time so that everyone 
is on the same page and understands how a lab session will operate when the 
instructor and TA are both present in the lab room. 
Oversee a Laboratory Course  |  165
If you plan on having TAs lead your lab sessions, respect your TA’s 
authority in front of their lab students. Interrupting the TA, contradicting 
what the TA says, answering student questions before the TA can respond, 
and many other considerations may lower the TA’s authority over their 
students and negatively affect the lab room’s student-teacher atmosphere. 
As a TA, establishing a tone of civil authority is crucial in the first few weeks 
of the semester and will help build rapport and trust with students. As 
the instructor, if you happen to hear the TA say something incorrect, we 
recommend that you refrain from interrupting to correct them unless it is 
particularly urgent. Everyone makes mistakes or misspeaks, and sometimes 
little corrections are not needed (e.g., if a TA writes “Ca” on the chalkboard 
but says “Ca2+”, it is clear that the TA meant the common valence charge of 
“two plus” when writing it on the board). If a correction is needed, then you 
can quietly talk to the TA on the side (e.g., “I heard you tell the students that 
the answer to question three is only [certain answer], but [another answer] is 
also acceptable for [specific reason]”). This way, the TA can then address the 
students and announce their mistake and perhaps write it on the chalkboard, 
and you have corrected the issue without interfering with your TA’s lab room. 
Avoiding interruptions in an ongoing lab session also gives the TA a great 
way to build trust with their students. We have learned that students are 
more likely to respect an instructor who admits to a mistake and clears up 
a misunderstanding for the student’s benefit. Recognizing and correcting 
mistakes gives the TA a good chance to display humility; we all get things 
wrong occasionally. It is critical to correct ourselves in front of students! 
Also, if you are a professor, you do not need to ”one-up” your TA, or vice 
versa. Your students are aware that you are the course’s main instructor, and 
the TA is still a graduate (or even undergraduate) student. 
In summary, when considering whether or not to attend lab sections 
regularly, you should consider how many chefs are “too many for the 
kitchen,” as the saying goes. Co-teaching lecture courses without a cohesive 
plan does not work well, and it does not work well for labs either. The topic 
of co-teaching will be discussed in more detail in a later chapter. Consider 
how the instructor-to-student-ratio might affect student learning. Will the 
students feel intimidated with two sets of eyes watching them instead of 
one? Will the students know who to ask for help? Will the students feel 
comfortable making mistakes and learning from those mistakes in front of 
both instructors? Make sure the students and the TAs know and understand 
what your role as the instructor is when you are in the lab room versus the 
166  |  Oversee a Laboratory Course
lecture room. Additionally, it might be helpful if either the instructor or TA 
announces to the students at the start of a given lab session what the role of 
the instructor will be in the lab room. 
Here are examples of what to say when you attend a lab: 
•
“Good morning students, today I’ll be sitting in to observe the lab
session. I’m working with the TAs to do teaching evaluations, so I’ll be
sitting in the back taking notes. Please pretend I’m not here and direct
all questions to your TA.”
•
“Hello everyone, I wanted to come to the lab today because this is my
favorite lab of the semester. TA will explain the procedure and get you
started as usual, and I’ll also be here to help you as you go and answer
questions.”
•
“I’ll be driving one of the two vans for our field trip today. Once we get
to the site, I’ll hand over the lab to [TA name] as usual.”
As the instructor, attending lab sections that are led by your TAs is fine 
and, in some cases, highly encouraged. However, we suggest visiting the labs 
thoughtfully and with the intent to maintain students’ respect for their TA 
and you. Asking TAs what they think of the above points is also an excellent 
idea to make them feel their opinions are valued. Failing to consider all 
the points discussed above may cause frustration for the TAs and students, 
ultimately resulting in a poor teaching and learning environment. 
Mentoring TAs to Ensure Effective Teaching 
If you as the instructor view your relationship with your TAs as a mentor 
instead of a manager, you are more likely to gain TA and student respect 
and foster active learning. Your TAs are likely learning how to teach, so 
it is your job to help them in the process. If you as the instructor lack 
teaching experience or you have no training in education, then there is 
no shame in learning with your TAs. An example would be to devise an 
active learning activity, for either lecture or lab, and ask your TAs to assist 
in the activity and provide feedback. A lot of teaching is simply trial and 
error. Seeking out pedagogical resources, many of which are open access 
online, would be a great task to do with your TAs. After exploring some 
Oversee a Laboratory Course  |  167
educational training resources online, use the weekly TA prep meetings to 
brainstorm better ways to present the learning objectives at the beginning 
of a given lab and the discussion component following activities at the end. 
Take this meeting time as an opportunity to explore and try new teaching 
methods that are low-stakes and do not necessarily change the main goals 
and objectives of a given lab. Additionally, supposing you are not formally 
trained in education, it is not advisable to direct your TAs to perform specific 
pedagogical practices in which you have no experience. Even if you have 
education training, it is better to mentor rather than manage your TAs 
teaching style, giving them the room and flexibility to learn and evaluate 
their teaching as they desire. 
One aspect of mentoring is providing evaluation and feedback to young 
professionals where necessary. Remember as the instructor to give criticism 
sandwiched between compliments and positive comments; the TA will be 
less likely to take your feedback into consideration if it only focuses on 
the negative aspects of their performance. Help your TAs recognize the 
importance of maintaining a growth mindset by sharing experiences of how 
you as an early educator struggled to improve in certain areas and succeeded 
in the end. If you plan to evaluate a TA, do not sit in on their lab unannounced 
or without an observation plan, but rather be clear and transparent on how 
you will conduct an observation. For example, are you going to jot down 
some notes, or will you use a form? When and how will you discuss the 
assessment with the TA? It is not appropriate to discuss a TA’s evaluation 
in front of other TAs or students. If you have multiple TAs, then all of them 
need to be equally evaluated. Typically, teaching evaluations are required 
for internal purposes by your university department. Even if you are not 
planning or required to conduct teaching evaluations, keep in mind that 
one of your TAs might request one for professional development purposes. 
Your TA evaluation efforts can be used later in a reference letter or teaching 
portfolio. 
168  |  Oversee a Laboratory Course
Utilizing TAs in Various Components of a Course 
Teaching assistants can be wonderful assets in a professor’s lecture class and 
their fellow TAs’ lab sections. Their participation can include guest lecturing, 
co-teaching with other TAs (discussed below), proctoring exams, and helping 
other TAs during particularly resource-intensive and time demanding 
classroom or lab activities. If your course has a laboratory section, it likely 
includes a lecture section as well. As the instructor, consider if you want 
your TAs to attend the lecture sections to better understand what students 
are learning. Having your TAs attend lecture classes might help them teach 
more effectively in their lab section(s) and it is especially helpful if they lack 
experience in the subject area or if it is their first-time teaching. However, 
your TAs might already be busy teaching a 3-hour lab once or twice a week 
and spending another 1-3 hours per week preparing for the lab, grading 
assignments, and addressing student questions through email and in-person 
office hours. When requesting the attendance of your graduate TAs in the 
lecture, consider their teaching appointment (i.e., 10-20 hours per week) 
and the fact that they are also working on their research in addition to the 
teaching assignment. 
If you require TA attendance during the lecture, then try to make good 
use of their time. Some examples of TA lecture duties may include passing 
out and collecting papers, helping students with classroom group work or 
activities, keeping track of attendance, and watching for students who are 
struggling. If you only want TAs to attend the lecture so that they are aware 
of the lecture material and schedule, consider an alternative to save your TAs 
some time in their schedules. For example, you may inform students during 
weekly lab meetings about what was covered in the lecture, whether you are 
on schedule or behind, and so on. Guest lecturing is a valid option to have 
on the table and it is an excellent learning and resume-building opportunity 
for graduate students. Additionally, guest lecturing may help professors with 
their workload and semester travel plans. Further, one of your TAs might 
specialize in a particular topic due to research experience or because they 
have taken many courses on the subject. Students taking the class will likely 
gain new perspectives and encouragement for pursuing advanced degrees 
if they observe and learn from a graduate student who is guest lecturing. 
Further, just as you (i.e., lead TA or professor) should communicate with 
your TAs regarding their roles in the lab room, you should also express your 
Oversee a Laboratory Course  |  169
expectations of TAs in the lecture portion of the course, if one exists. If 
you would like for the TA to help students work on an in-lecture exercise, 
demonstrate the task and expected results to the TA before class. Although 
the TA may know the course material quite well, this does not guarantee that 
they can follow a specific problem if they are put on the spot in the lecture 
room without first being adequately prepped. The TA may provide a different 
answer that is correct, but not one that you considered, or the TA might 
provide an incorrect or unhelpful answer; thus, it is best to make a plan 
beforehand so that everyone is on the same page. Additionally, one TA might 
have suggestions for improvements to the lecture lesson plan or concerns 
about the feasibility of a particular in-class activity. Thus, preparing your TAs 
for the in-lecture exercise beforehand and having a discussion afterwards 
on what went well will help build upon the professional relationship and 
improve the teaching and learning environment for everyone. 
Undergraduate TAs and sometimes graduate TAs, if they attended the 
same university for their undergraduate degree, may have recently taken 
the lab course to be taught. A TA that has recently completed your course 
might give a unique perspective to your class. For example, if you have a 
TA who has taken your course, this TA may provide you with better insight 
into whether certain lab activities worked for the students. If you make small 
changes to your course every semester, asking this TA for insight could be 
incredibly helpful. They might tell you that a particular lab required much 
more explanation than given, but that the students were too confused to 
ask for help, so you might not have noticed. Or, the TA might inform you 
of topics that the students found especially interesting. The smaller the 
age (or experience) gap, the more relevant the insight your TA will be able 
to give you when you are developing and making changes to your course. 
Conversely, a graduate student who took a similar course with a different 
professor at another university may offer insight and other ideas that you 
may decide to incorporate into your lab course. 
170  |  Oversee a Laboratory Course
Fostering a Positive Learning Environment 
An essential part of being an educator of any sort is making everyone in 
the classroom feel welcome. Teaching laboratory-based courses requires 
students to work closely with others and be comfortable asking for help, 
especially since lab activities are almost entirely hands-on. Thus, reassuring 
students and even other TAs that you (instructor) are here to support them 
in your highest capacity is an effective way to boost morale and increase 
learning for all. In the lab, there will be a variety of students with different 
backgrounds and experiences. Since there will also be a variety of preferred 
learning styles from students in the classroom, we advise TAs to mix up their 
teaching style to include passive and active forms of engagement during 
each lab session. For example, instead of asking questions by calling on 
individual students during pre-and post-lab discussions, opt for allowing 
students to form group discussions first before sharing with the entire class, 
or pass around notecards for students to write down their answers, which is 
particularly helpful for more introverted individuals. 
At the start of the semester, make sure to review the resources your 
university provides for students with accessibility issues. As the instructor, 
make sure to educate your TAs on the proper protocols for accommodating 
students with disabilities (e.g., the deadline for students to provide an 
accommodation letter). As the lab TA, be sure to remind students of your 
office hours and frequently offer help sessions outside of the scheduled 
lab class. Other considerations for improving the learning environment as 
the instructor or TA would be to write a diversity statement in the front 
matter of your lab manual and utilize pronouns (e.g., she, her), encouraging 
students to feel comfortable doing so as well if they wish. Another important 
consideration is the accessibility of instructional materials, whether as a 
word document (e.g., syllabus, lab manual) or educational video. There are 
many online resources that help guide instructors on how to convert online 
documents, handouts, and videos to more accessible versions for students, 
from providing hyperlinks in Microsoft Word to generating captions for 
videos and other media. Visit this webpage to find several resources and 
articles from the National Center on Disability and Access to Education: 
https://ncdae.org/resources/. 
Oversee a Laboratory Course  |  171
Another consideration is including TAs in the preparation of lab activities. 
For example, it might be helpful for you as the instructor to request 
constructive feedback during weekly meetings and, if necessary, recruit help 
in designing or reviewing a new lab activity or modifying lab procedures 
from previous semesters. Whether or not a TA has any experience with 
a particular subject, they may have helpful insight into how a lab activity 
could be improved, particularly after having taught a given lab. If you, as the 
instructor, have not taught a lab section for several semesters, you may have 
lost sight of how a particular lab is conducted. Thus, you may be stuck in 
the conventional way of how a given lab was run while ignoring new and 
potentially more effective strategies. Therefore, it is essential to provide TAs 
with a platform to voice their opinions and concerns. Making a concerted 
effort to include TAs in the discussion will only improve everyone’s learning 
and teaching environment. 
Co-Teaching 
Many of the same principles discussed above apply to co-teaching with 
faculty members or TAs. Some examples include attending the co-teacher’s 
lab or lecture and maintaining effective communication regarding co-
teacher roles, responsibilities, and expectations. It is generally best practice 
to stay engaged and attentive while your fellow TA or faculty member is 
teaching lab or lecture. In some cases, co-teaching may be a viable option. 
For example, in the soils lab course at VT, we had one of our undergraduate 
TAs, who are less experienced, co-teach with a more experienced graduate 
TA. During the first one or two labs, the undergraduate TA simply assisted 
the other TA to see how the lab is run before taking on any active teaching 
roles. The graduate TA guided, mentored, and offered suggestions for how 
and where the undergraduate TA could be useful. Depending on the 
undergraduate TA’s level of experience, the laboratory instruction may be 
split in half; that is, one TA may discuss some of the material (e.g., more 
technical), while the other TA covers the remaining material (e.g., less 
technical). During co-teaching, it is essential to keep the flow of the 
instruction logical, organized, and clear for students. Thus, it might be 
helpful to briefly overview “who will teach what and when” at the start of the 
172  |  Oversee a Laboratory Course
lab. Also, if there is more than one lab activity, the co-teaching tasks may 
be split up between different activities (instead of both teachers covering 
one topic) to give students appropriate time to adjust to different teaching 
styles and personalities. Co-teaching may involve many other scenarios, 
such as co-teaching with two faculty members in a lecture-style classroom. 
As one might expect, co-teaching includes both pros and cons related to 
classroom size, instructor personality, experience level, background, conflict 
management styles, and so forth. Before setting up a co-taught classroom, 
there are several considerations to take into account. Co-teaching has 
several advantages in lab-based hands-on courses since students benefit 
from greater one-on-one guidance and support. Based on our experiences 
co-teaching with both undergraduate and graduate TAs, we created a list 
of benefits and considerations that should be addressed before co-teaching 
with other TAs (Table 8.3). We recommend exploring Cook and Friend (1995), 
which is an article covering many key topics related to co-teaching. 
Table 8.3 The benefits and considerations of co-teaching a laboratory course.

Conclusions 
Laboratory courses require a combination of teaching strategies and 
generally take more preparation and time-management skills. Additionally, 
since lab-based courses usually involve multiple TAs and may include both 
a lecture and lab component within the course, it is essential to keep 
expectations clear among the instructional team and student-teacher. 
Maintaining effective communication between TAs and instructors should 
help create a well-functioning laboratory and an enjoyable working 
environment. Students who take lab-based courses may not be accustomed 
to the hands-on nature and group-learning format of lab classes. It is the 
responsibility of the TA or instructor to be prepared for every lab, help 
students stay engaged with the learning content, and facilitate discussions 
regarding the importance of each topic. Perhaps the best way to succeed 
in a lab course as an educator is to stay prepared and organized, which 
will in turn increase confidence. Proper lab planning and preparation, as 
described in this chapter, will allow the lab field trip, activity, or procedure 
to run smoothly and create a meaningful learning environment for most 
students. To effectively oversee a lab course as the lead instructor, it is 
necessary to provide clear instructions and expectations for your TAs. The 
teaching expectations in lab-based courses go beyond what is expected from 
a traditional lecture-style course. Even the seemingly smallest efforts, such 
as creating detailed TA guides for each lab and having a weekly coordination 
meeting, can have a positive impact on TA performance.

(10) Summary Questions
1.
What is the main soil forming factor that is different between the two
soils (Brush Mtn. and TRC)?
Parent material rock type (but not soil type, both are residuum). Brush
Mountain is sandstone (soil pit 1), TRC is limestone (soil pit 2).

-1 point if ‘parent material’ alone is given without rock type.
2.
How does this soil forming factor influence the soil morphological
properties and land use management of the two soils? Compare and
contrast for each soil.
Soil Pit 1: yellowish brown, shallow, sandy, Bw horizon. The sandstone is
not easily weatherable; thus, shallow to bedrock which affects
conventional septic systems. Steep slopes and sandier, less fertile soils
make forestry the best land use option.Soil Pit 2: reddish brown, deep,
clayey, Bt horizon. Less restrictions. Deeper soil and higher clay
content makes this a better agricultural soil. The gentle sloping
landscape is easier to develop.
4 points total. 2 points per soil for key morphological properties (depth,
texture) and land use.
-1 point if overall depth or texture is incorrect or not mentioned.
-1 point if land use is incorrect or not mentioned.

3. Explain how the climate differs at the two soil locations. 
Brush mountain is on the top of a mountain, TRC is in the valley. Brush 
Mountain is a few degrees colder than the TRC. Brush Mountain is also 
north facing, which would be colder than the SW aspect at TRC. 
3 points total: 
-1 point if no thorough explanation (i.e., just ‘Brush Mtn is colder’). 
-3 points if no answer or given answer is not climate related.

VIGNETTE: Use of Personal 
Response System in Classrooms 
SIHUI MA 
Years of research on neuroscience and the scholarship of teaching and 
learning have provided solid evidence that students get knowledge through 
active learning (National Research Council, 2000). Instead of pouring 
knowledge into students’ heads (passive learning), active learning requires 
students to construct understanding rather than purely receiving. Often, 
active learning provides students a richer experience than listening to 
lectures that likely involve elaborative encoding and experiential memory 
(Brown, 2014). Personal response systems—from traditional handheld 
iClickers to smartphone-based applications such as TopHat to the polling 
function of Zoom for virtual classrooms—is one practical tool that can allow 
teachers to implement active learning in the classroom (Silberman, 1996). 
In addition to active learning and student engagement, personal response 
systems provide instant evidence of student learning. It is well-established 
that we learn from practice and feedback (Schmidt, 2019). By giving frequent 
evaluations about student performance, we help our students learn through 
guidance on future effort. However, if the feedback is not provided early on, 
it is less effective at helping students stay on track after multiple attempts. 
The use of a personal response system in the classroom can prompt 
feedback on student learning that can be incorporated in subsequent 
teaching and learning.

Vignette: Personal Response Sysem  |  179
Before investing in personal response systems, teachers often consider 
the following questions: (1) Which one should I choose, handheld or 
smartphone-based? (2) How much does it cost? (3) Does it improve the 
academic performance of students? (4) Do students like it? (5) Is it a 
distraction to students? The research findings on using a smartphone-based 
application (TopHat) in an undergraduate Food Science class may provide 
you some insights into the above questions (S. Ma, Steger, Doolittle, & 
Stewart, 2018; Sihui Ma et al., 2020). TopHat is an application that students 
install on their smartphones. Using the Polls and Quizzes function, teachers 
can ask fourteen different types of questions to assess student learning. In 
this class, TopHat was used to break down each of the 50-min lectures into 
three shorter episodes. 
We chose the smartphone-based personal response systems over the 
traditional handheld ones for several reasons. 
1.
For student learning, this application allows for the ability to use
questions other than simply true/false or multiple-choice—for
example, circling the wine production region on a map.
2.
Additionally, we were curious if we can turn smartphones into an
instructional tool for both teaching and learning. We cannot deny that
we bring our smartphones everywhere, and use them frequently,
including attending classes via their device (Tindell & Bohlander, 2012).
On the other hand, we cannot deny the evidence that multitasking,
such as listening to lectures while using smartphones, is detrimental to
student learning and performance (Schmidt, 2020). These significant
problems bring us the golden opportunity to teach our students to use
their smartphones to help them learn effectively.
3.
This is a new area of research that we want to explore and eventually
contribute our findings to the scholarship of teaching and learning.
The cost of using TopHat is problematic. The Pro version of TopHat is free 
for teachers, but students may need to pay. The basic version of TopHat is 
free to students, but it only comes with the polling feature; the quiz feature 
is not included. So if you would like to assign points to the questions that 
are implemented using TopHat and include the points in your grade book, 
students will need to purchase the Pro version, which (as of this writing) 
is $30 per student for four months, or $48 per student for 12 months. The 
cost is more justifiable if students use TopHat in multiple classes for multiple 
180  |  Vignette: Personal Response Sysem
terms or if the institution purchases a campus-wide subscription (TopHat, 
2021). Another cost-saving approach is to ask the teaching and learning 
center on campus if they are willing to cover the cost through teaching 
enhancement grants, but this method may not be sustainable. 
We found that using TopHat in lectures improved student performance 
in the Wines and Vines class. Student performance was measured using the 
scores on quizzes. Students performed better on quizzes covering content 
in which TopHat was used in the lectures than for content in which TopHat 
was not used in the lectures. However, this effect was only observed on 
questions that assess lower levels of thinking (Remembering, Understanding, 
and Applying) as defined by Bloom’s Taxonomy, not those that assess higher 
levels of thinking (Analyzing, Evaluating, and Creating). In other words, if you 
are teaching a lower-level undergraduate class in which most of the learning 
objectives involve lower cognitive thinking, using TopHat in the lectures is 
likely to help the student learn and perform better. 
We used a survey at the end of each semester to collect student 
perceptions of the use of TopHat. Students believed that the use of TopHat 
improved their learning, encouraged more higher-level thinking during 
class, and improved their focus on the course. They also considered TopHat 
easy and straightforward to use. However, we do not know if students would 
still like to use TopHat if they had to pay for it. 
We also gathered information from the survey results about whether 
students think they are distracted by using their smartphones to answer 
TopHat questions. Although the self-reported data show that students feel 
using TopHat did not divert their attention from the course, our observations 
tell us that students are likely to use their smartphones for non-instructional 
purposes after finishing TopHat questions. Further, the instructors observed 
that the use of smartphones caused a multitasking distraction that lasted at 
least 5 minutes following the TopHat questions. Students may be confident 
in their multitasking capabilities and may not believe multitasking negatively 
affects their learning. Substantial evidence gathered from research 
demonstrates negative consequences from distracted learning (Schmidt, 
2020). However, students will not change their behaviors or stop using their 
smartphones for non-instructional purposes during class if they do not 
believe multitasking interrupts their learning (May & Elder, 2018). Teachers 
can help students understand the negative impact of distracted learning by 
demonstrating it in class activities (Schmidt, 2020). 
Vignette: Personal Response Sysem  |  181
Overall, the use of smartphone-based personal response systems during 
lectures can improve student academic performance, and students reported 
that they like to use them if they are free. However, smartphone use for 
instructional purposes may introduce a distraction to the classroom—that is, 
multitasking by using the smartphones for non-instructional purposes while 
learning. Teachers need to strategically incorporate smartphone-based 
personal response systems to serve their purpose of facilitating learning and 
avoiding the negative impact of distraction.

Mentoring Students in Research
Practices Inside and Outside the
Classroom
ANNE M. BROWN 
Introduction 
Graduate students and faculty often engage in supporting, training, 
teaching, and mentoring undergraduate researchers in order to achieve 
research project milestones and to contribute to university experiential 
learning initiatives, much as you may be doing now. However, as you may 
have found, little training or guidance exists on how to successfully engage 
and train students in the research environment of an R1 university setting. 
Undergraduate research is identified by the Association of American 
Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) as a high-impact practice (HIP) (AAC&U, 
2020). These undergraduate research experiences can be very valuable in 
enhancing workforce development skills for undergraduates, but lack of 
planning, project scope, training, acknowledgment of skill level, and 
consideration for how to best train and teach students can be challenges for 
both graduate students and faculty. This chapter outlines an organizational 
teaching structure that can be used to engage students in undergraduate

research in a traditional (e.g., classroom) and a non-traditional (e.g., research 
lab) environment. Additionally, this chapter offers best practices to ensure 
a successful experience in teaching, training, and mentoring undergraduate 
research students in a research-intensive university setting. 
This chapter will discuss… 
• 
Strategies for structuring research experiences in a 
classroom or lab environment. 
• 
Practices to incorporate in the mentorship of students in 
undergraduate research 
Background 
The role of experiential learning in higher education is expanding as new 
initiatives and strategic plans incorporate and support the practice in the 
undergraduate career of all students (Eyler, 2009). Pioneered by David Kolb 
in the 1980s, experiential learning can be cyclic and moves students from 
“concrete experiences” to “active experimentation/application”, with 
reflection and conceptualization components integrated into the cycle (Kolb, 
1984). As a collective whole in higher education, “experiential learning” is 
frequently used synonymously with the term “experiential education.” 
Experiential education is often viewed as the broader philosophy of the 
complete educational pathway of a student, whereas experiential learning 
applies to an individual learning experience. This experiential learning 
process benefits students by grounding the theoretical core domain 
knowledge in an applied setting, where it harnesses the creativity of 
students to promote deeper levels of critical thinking, and it can incorporate 
Teaching, Training, and Mentoring  |  185
a “trial-by-error” level of confidence and engagement with the material 
(Kolb & Kolb, 2018). Experiential learning can take many forms, including 
field work, internships, service-learning, and, in the context of this chapter, 
undergraduate research. 
Undergraduate research experiences (UREs) can be a pivotal experience 
for students, regardless of major and anticipated career routes (NASEM, 
2019). Undergraduate research is considered one of the high-impact 
practices (HIPs) defined by the Association of American Colleges and 
Universities (AAC&U) and can benefit students by its integration in a 
classroom setting or in an applied learning setting (e.g., in a lab, in the 
field, etc.) (AAC&U, 2020). Often, undergraduate research is not a well-
understood activity for undergraduate students in their first and second 
year, especially at a research-intensive (R1) university. Students often hear 
about undergraduate research opportunities, but are rarely exposed to what 
that represents for both the institution and for them in their own personal 
career journeys. As faculty members in the university, we can fill this 
knowledge gap by improving the communication systems to emphasize the 
utility and impact of undergraduate research, alongside training in research 
and data literacy, on our students’ durable skills. 
Research as a broad conceptualization can engage students in thinking 
about questions they have about the world or an area of personal topic 
interest, promote a route for them to explore these questions, and ultimately 
collect necessary information (data!) to make decisions. Students develop a 
variety of skills such as information management, data management, data 
ethics, and problem solving during a URE. Importantly, students can leverage 
these UREs in their future careers—the major skills of critical thinking/
problem solving, communication (oral, written, digital), and teamwork/
collaboration that are developed during a URE influence the abilities of 
individuals in every sector of the workforce (McClure-Brenchley et al., 2020). 
Conveying the broad skillsets learned in an URE, in addition to the domain-
specific technical aspects, can be incredibly useful in promoting these 
experiences for students and often enhance engagement as well (Brown et 
al., 2016). Describing these topics to the students as both skills learned and 
marketable features as they enter the next steps of their careers can further 
clarify the role of the university research enterprise to students. 
As faculty members and graduate students, we can recognize the 
importance of UREs for undergraduates, but how do we creatively, 
strategically, and equitably engage students in these skills without 
186  |  Teaching, Training, and Mentoring
overtaxing our own capacities? We must structure an unstructured 
experience, frame skill development, and focus on both research theory and 
domain specific training to provide an exceptional experience for students 
and the instructors (Brown et al., 2016). This chapter will discuss these 
practices in the classroom and in the research lab, where each setting has 
different goals and outcomes, but can benefit from commonalities in 
approach to engaging students in research. 
Teaching and Mentoring Students in Research in 
the Classroom 
Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) are becoming 
increasingly more common as a means to consistently engage a larger group 
of students in active-learning of research skills (Bangera & Brownell, 2014; 
Dolan, 2016). CUREs can be framed as a repeated, tested implementation 
or a certain research methodology that still maintains authentic inquiry by 
the student or as a research project related to the research interests of the 
instructor. Specifically for the latter example, individuals have implemented 
CUREs in a biology curriculum to have multiple student groups participate in 
a stepwise test of mutations of certain protein structures, using the student 
human power as a means to more widely scan for impact of mutation. 
Regardless of the intention and implementation, students are able to 
participate in this experience for course credit, easily integrate the 
experience into their schedule, and in some cases get required course credit 
for degree completion. 
CUREs are not without challenges. For example, the time to instruct or 
serve as a teaching assistant (TA) in a CURE is much more time intensive 
than other courses, such that students often have issues in motivation and 
ownership of projects, and TAs lack the expertise to mentor students in a 
CURE environment (Heim & Holt, 2019). Having implemented a CURE for a 
first-year, 1 credit, P/F environment in the field of biochemistry, personal 
experience indicates these challenges are justified. 
Teaching, Training, and Mentoring  |  187
There are some strategies that have aided in the mitigation and improved 
experience (of both the instructor and the TA): 
1. Outline requirements up front. On the first day of class, we provide 
the rubrics, instructions, and expectations for the final deliverables of 
the CURE. Students are grouped either naturally at the start of class 
(using a SCALE-UP classroom, students naturally join tables) or in 
virtual teaching—via randomized assignment to smaller “breakout 
rooms” wherein small groups of students can synchronously 
collaborate until allocated group time ends. Students remain in these 
groups for the entire semester. Originally, we did not define group roles 
(i.e., everybody had an equal role). However, in more recent iterations 
of the course each person/group fills a specific role (project manager, 
lead data collection, lead writer, lead presentation design, etc.) so that 
there are more tangible responsibilities up front and students can 
conceptualize the process throughout the entire semester on the first 
day. Second, framing the project in terms of specific roles helped 
students properly conceptualize the complexity of collaborative 
research. As instructors, we also created all sign-up sheets for these 
roles (via Google Sheets) and shared notes documents (via Google Docs) 
and have these linked on the homepage of the course learning 
management system (LMS). These specific tools were chosen because 
they had the lowest barriers to access, requiring only a browser and 
limited processing power. The clarity of expectations and routes to 
move forward have improved student engagement and diminished 
confusion. 
2. Explicitly discuss the impact on their skills and careers. In the first-
day materials, there is an explicit slide that details the skills to be 
taught and the objectives that will be experienced/performed by the 
student. These include basic research and data literacy skills (file 
management, file naming, data ethics, consumption of credible 
information, teamwork, writing and presentation skills) and domain 
specific, technical skills (for our course – command line interface, bash 
scripting, molecular visualization, summary statistics, etc.). After 
polling the class for general career interests, we then use at least one of 
those skills as an example in a career case the student might encounter. 
While the actual topic of the CURE implemented in the course might 
not be a direct interest of the student, the students can now 
188  |  Teaching, Training, and Mentoring
conceptualize how this process can be beneficial for them. This has 
helped with the issues of ownership and follow-through of students. 
3. Offer incentives. While not possible in all situations, many universities 
offer an end-of-semester research symposium. Students have indicated 
that a final poster presentation that is attended by non-class faculty 
and students is an incentive. Additionally, students can add this 
presentation and/or symposium to their resume. Participating in a 
symposium hosted outside of the class might be extra work for a 
graduate teaching assistant (GTA) or instructor, so other opportunities 
include inviting faculty of the discipline to attend an in-class digital 
poster session (using screens in a large classroom or meeting room) at 
the end of the year. This then creates networking opportunities, which 
is a big attraction for students. Additionally, some of the research 
training modules in the course (e.g., data management, data ethics, etc.) 
have all been designed to be a digital credential (sometimes referred to 
as badge) so students will have records of completion as they explore 
internships or other on-campus research opportunities. 
4. Don’t forget to be a mentor. We have all struggled in the process of 
research in a variety of ways. Convey that to your students and 
humanize yourself and the process of research. Sometimes we focus 
solely on completing the in-class activities of the day and reaching the 
final deliverables of a course. With a CURE, however, there will be down 
time for the instructor to be circulating the room. One strategy that 
was very helpful was making sure each group had a regular check-in. 
How was their project going? What questions did they have? Did they 
know why they were doing today’s task? Finally, and what might be 
most important, how were they doing in general? How was their 
semester going? Were they excited about something coming up? Those 
questions greatly influenced the collegiality of the course and made the 
entire class, not just an individual group, feel like a team. These 
questions additionally opened the door for students to ask the 
questions they might be hesitant to ask out of lack of confidence, and 
even comment “I learned about things I didn’t know I needed to learn 
about.” 
These four strategies have been helpful in finding balance and having clear 
expectations for both the student and instructor during a CURE. For a GTA, 
it can be useful to have all of the planning and expectations of the student 
Teaching, Training, and Mentoring  |  189
deliverables completed at the start of the semester so that both the student 
and GTA know the final goal. Instructing or acting as a TA for a course that 
includes a CURE can be a rewarding experience and will be quite different 
from a lecture experience. Working with students in this capacity can also be 
a fantastic experience for GTAs earlier in their career, as mentoring students 
in the completion of a research task can develop their own mentorship and 
research skills. 
Teaching and Mentoring Students in Research in 
the Lab 
More structured undergraduate research experiences in the lab setting can 
be beneficial in supporting inclusivity and STEM retention (NASEM, 2019; 
Hernandez et al., 2018). While it might seem oxymoronic since 
undergraduate research is about exploration and discovery, students need 
structure when learning many of the technical and procedural aspects of 
undergraduate research. Students are accustomed to being in a defined 
learning environment and classroom. Expectations are highlighted on the 
first day and there is a pretty standard procedure of events. However, often 
it is solely up to the principal investigator (PI) to determine how a research 
experience is structured. This structure varies greatly even among 
instructors within the same department. While that freedom for the PI 
is warranted, we need to consider how that can affect the student and 
the GRA (graduate research assistant) that might become the central point 
of contact with the student. Implementing structure and training in both 
domain specific techniques and research methodology is necessary in order 
to provide a comprehensive training and experience for undergraduate 
research students and best utilize graduate student and faculty time and 
resources. Structuring the “standard” parts of the research process, like 
end of semester goals and deliverables, highlighting the timetable in which 
certain major milestones should be reached (which should not be tied to 
actual research results obtained), developing a grading/accountability scale, 
and presenting expectations in a way that students are used to will alleviate a 
lot of repetitive questions and provide a sandbox for the student to develop. 
This structured approach has been studied (Brown, Lewis, & Bevan, 2016) by 
190  |  Teaching, Training, and Mentoring
examining the pre- and post-implementation of a structured undergraduate 
research experience, and the value and utilization of a structure in 
undergraduate research experiences, and highlights the impact of 
continuous iterations and lessons learned implemented since deployment. 
Tips for implementing structure but allowing sandbox creativity are as 
follows: 
1.
Use a syllabus. While it might seem confining or unnecessary to have a
syllabus for a URE, most students are receiving credit for their time in
the research lab. This credit is counted equally to any other course
credit they receive, so why not have the same standardization that
students are used to? We have found that having a syllabus greatly
streamlines the process and semester expectations that already exist in
other UREs as well as in other courses (e.g., paper, weekly participation,
documentation, etc.) and defines expectations in a way that makes clear
the grade the students will receive for credit. This has greatly enhanced
our ability to host more undergraduate research students and has
provided equitable settings for all students—from those starting in their
first semester to those that have been in the lab for years.While the
syllabus is a useful tool for setting student expectations, it is also highly
valuable for the instructor and GRA. There are times when students
might vanish, becoming unresponsive to emails and not heard from
again. Perhaps the student is overwhelmed, overcommitted, or other
issues have arisen; it therefore becomes more difficult for the
instructor to assign a grade if there is no track-record of accountability
and no route to prove that assignment of the given grade was
warranted. This can also ease the stress of a GRA who has a student
who is not showing up and provides easy documentation to show the PI
the issues occurring without feeling responsible for them.
2.
Create structured training protocols. Students starting in the research
lab will likely have minimal training both in the concepts of the
research process and in the specific techniques utilized in the research
group. Therefor we have found it useful to implement a standardized
training process that all students must complete regardless of skill
level. This provides equitable scaffolding for all students to join the
group and requires output of the student so skill level and interest in
research can be assessed and students can be more appropriately
matched to projects based on these skills and interests. While some
Teaching, Training, and Mentoring  |  191
labs might not be able to afford that level or time commitment of 
training, it has paid off in the outputs after the first semester. 
3.
Use an online platform for protocols and training. All aforementioned
training is hosted on an LMS, which makes new students joining the
group much easier to handle once the initial time investment in
module/training material creation has occurred. Having all tutorials for
the specific lab and training in one place, be it be on an LMS, an Open
Science Framework, or an internal website, the central location and
focus of a purposeful training can ease the burden of students
integrating into the lab and developing the skills need to work on
research projects.
4.
Implement several indicators of “success.” Often, GRAs or PIs expect
students will produce stellar research results right out of the gate. In
reality, this will not often be the case. Developing the skills to revise
and re-do experiments in order to grow is a core component of the
research process and it is our responsibility to develop the acceptance
of and need for iteration in students. It is important for students to
experience that the first time we do something, especially in research,
it will often not result in a final product. Iteration and the normalness
of this process of improvement needs to be both communicated and
embraced. The little wins—the connection of two pieces of information,
forward movement even if small, or having a good student
discussion—need to be acknowledged. PIs should be gracious with their
GRAs and praise their overall interaction and work with a student,
especially when the student grasps a difficult topic or continually
improves at their presentations in group meetings. Looking at the
process holistically, not solely based on the research outputs, will
improve morale and motivation in the undergraduate research student
and the team as a whole. There are occasions when GRAs may become
stressed that it will reflect poorly on them as the GRA that a student is
not performing—and you should remind them of the overall goals and
various measures of success. We are all in different places in our life
and we must be kind and observant of this with our students. We are
here to perform high-quality research and to mentor the next
generation in research and data literacy, and prepare them for their
next steps in their careers. This approach and attitude can greatly
improve team morale, relieve stress, and indirectly, improve the
research outputs.
192  |  Teaching, Training, and Mentoring
Imposing a structured framework on the research process a student 
partakes in during a lab-based URE can benefit the student, GRA, and 
instructor. The general structure, grading scheme, expectations, and routes 
to find information related to the URE should be easy to access and find 
(e.g., one central location). Standardization across all students enhances 
community and can help with students lacking confidence in an URE.. 
Openly and easily accessible trainings (e.g., publicly available and easy to 
find) and protocols can improve the transparency of research performed as 
well as teach best practices for both open research and open science. While 
there is some up-front time required to create the structure—specifically 
the syllabus and training materials—that time is recouped in the future with 
a system that makes it easy to bring new students on board. In the end, 
this structure and planning contributes to both the research and teaching 
enterprises of the university. 
Lessons Learned from Teaching and Mentoring 
Students in Undergraduate Research 
UREs are a fantastic experience that allow students to engage more deeply in 
a topic, experience success and failure in safe environments, and propel their 
curiosity and skills to the next level (Petrella & Jung, 2008). That is not to say 
that these experiences are not time-consuming for instructors and GRA/
GTAs, but the interactions, excitement, and outcomes that result can greatly 
outweigh the challenges. This chapter has highlighted the importance and 
role of experiential learning, specifically undergraduate research, in the 
education and development of the student in multiple settings. Routes and 
advice to deal with challenges of UREs in both the classroom environment 
and in the research lab setting are discussed, as well as highlighting the 
commonalities between them. Preparing and thinking about the kind of 
environment and setting you want to create in an URE is an important 
starting place. As instructors, we must continually consider how we frame 
and present to students the process of research, enhance their data literacy, 
and introduce domain-specific techniques and knowledge. Given the 
proliferation of misinformation, how we approach research and data literacy 
training via UREs is critical. 
Teaching, Training, and Mentoring  |  193
In retrospect as an instructor/PI in who both teaches an URE in a course 
and leads a large undergraduate research lab, these roles as a research 
instructor and research mentor are one of the most important, if not the 
most important, aspect of my position at the university. Mentorship has the 
ability to propagate long-lasting, far-reaching effects. The excitement that 
we demonstrate and the environment that we create in class and in the 
research lab has an ability to etch into the life experience of the student 
given the nature of UREs. UREs provide us the chance to be a mentor 
for both our students and our GRAs/GTAs. I have had and currently have 
exceptional mentors and I challenge myself to give back in the same way that 
I have benefited, propagating that cycle further. Just like framing of benefits 
is discussed in how to work with challenges of CUREs, it is important to 
conceptualize how important being a good mentor is at the onset of working 
with students in UREs. 
A piece of advice when conceptualizing mentorship in UREs: one cannot 
“blanket mentor.” That is, each student needs an individualized approach to 
their particular mentoring relationship. Start those conversations early, and 
know that while it is a time investment, it benefits both the mentee and the 
mentor in the long run. Mentorship is a learning process, and I encourage 
you to follow Slack channels, Twitter threads, and scholarship on the matter 
for advice and solutions. As academics, we all are continually refining our 
craft. Participate and challenge yourself in these mentorship conversations 
as well as in your approach to deploying UREs in the classroom and lab 
environments. The tips and techniques discussed in this chapter will 
hopefully improve your experience in engaging with students in research 
environments. If you are a GRA/GTA beginning your journey in mentoring 
undergraduates, do not hesitate to ask your PI/instructor/mentor questions 
about these topics and challenge yourselves to grow in this area; it will 
benefit you throughout your career, no matter the path you take.

VIGNETTE: Lessons Learned as a 
First-Time Experiential Learning 
Program Instructor 
CAITLIN CRIDLAND 
Introduction 
As a teaching assistant and Graduate Teaching Scholar for a summer 
experiential learning program, I have had a very different experience than 
many other TAs. The program I was involved in provided undergraduate 
students with hands-on basic and applied plant and food science research 
experiences. In addition to research experiences, scientific workshops are 
held throughout the summer to enhance student engagement with 
agricultural and food security techniques and issues, as are professional 
development workshops to help students navigate research labs and 
academia. During my last year as a Graduate Teaching Scholar, we were 
forced to pivot our usually in-person program online and provide a novel 
research experience virtually during a global pandemic. For those of you who 
are in similar positions working with an experiential learning program or 
course, or looking to include an experiential learning piece in your course, I 
hope this reflection on three lessons I learned can help you in your teaching 
journey.

1. Provide Clear Structure and Expectations from 
the Outset 
With the changing schedules of online, hybrid, and in-person teaching that 
2020 and 2021 brought, setting clear expectations and objectives for 
students was paramount for success. When designing the syllabus, create 
a consistent schedule, with recitations or report writing sessions spaced 
predictably throughout the semester. Schedule consistent deadlines and due 
dates for similar assignments or exams. For example, homework is always 
due on Fridays before class or exams are always on Thursdays. This structure 
helps keep the students on top of their deadlines in the class. Additionally, it 
helps you stay on top of grading, lesson planning, and assignment writing. 
 
In addition to creating structure within the course, set clear expectations 
for the different sessions/lab periods and the materials students are 
expected to bring with them to class. If your experiential learning course 
contains a recitation portion where students don’t need to bring personal 
protective equipment (PPE) but do need laptops or textbooks, communicate 
these expectations early on to avoid confusion. If your experiential learning 
course is online and students are running experiments from home, set 
expectations early about how you will check in with their experimental setup 
and data collection. For example, will you require students to share their 
experimental setup in real-time over Zoom, or is sharing a prerecorded 
video or photo sufficient? Setting these expectations early also provides 
time for you to help students access institutional resources if needed—for 
example, renting a laptop, iPad, or camera from the library. Similarly discuss 
expectations and etiquette that you will follow when using video 
conferencing. For example, do you prefer your students to have their video 
on the entire time? Do you mind if pets walk in and out of the background? 
Discussing your expectations, and also your students’ expectations, is 
important in this new environment. It is important to note here that with the 
pandemic, our schedules and responsibilities have changed, and expecting a 
pristine background, quiet kids and pets, and top-speed internet the entire 
time is unreasonable. Additionally, provide resources on how to use the 
video conferencing software or application to help your students with the 
transition to online meetings. 
198  |  Vignette: Experiental Learning
2. Be Flexible 
Just like in research, obstacles and delays are bound to occur in experiential 
learning. When I first started working with the program, I thought changing 
the schedule because of unavoidable delays or unexpected results would 
result in me looking disorganized and unprofessional. However, the longer 
I worked in research and teaching, the more I realized that adaptability 
and flexibility were key skills that students needed to learn. In addition 
to teaching students how to plan experiments and analyze data, we also 
need to teach students how to troubleshoot and adapt when experiments 
don’t go as planned. During my last summer with the experiential learning 
program, we had delays because the plants that students were growing 
weren’t growing as fast as they do in the lab. Instead of being worried 
(and also worrying the students) about how this delay would impact the 
schedule, we took the time to discuss their growing conditions and how 
different factors impact plant growth. By looking at other phenotypes the 
plants were displaying, we figured out that the lighting intensity for the 
at-home experiments was lower than in a lab setting, and discussed how 
this lower light could be impacting other phenotypes they were seeing in 
their experiments. From this experience, students came out with a better 
understanding of how abiotic factors impact plant growth, and how they 
could improve their experimental setup if they were to repeat the 
experiment. I encourage you to use problems that arise from students’ 
experiments as learning opportunities and still gather as much data from 
“failed” experiments as possible. Students will come out of your course with 
enhanced troubleshooting and critical thinking skills, which are important 
for researchers. 
Whether or not your course or program is in-person, virtual, or hybrid, 
your students may still be feeling the impacts of the pandemic. Changing 
responsibilities, online schooling, and reduced childcare access due to 
COVID-19 can all contribute to additional stress. Acknowledge the 
constantly changing current environment and the extra bandwidth and time 
this can take. While this “lesson learned” may seem contradictory to the 
previous lesson, I believe setting deadlines and being flexible work hand-in-
hand to make the students’ experience in experiential learning as beneficial 
as possible and your experience leading experiential learning as stress-free 
and organized as possible. 
Vignette: Experiental Learning  |  199
3. Check in Frequently 
Whether your experiential learning experience is in-person or online, 
checking in with your students frequently is a must. Checking in with 
students can include surveying students about the course material (e.g., 
Do you feel like you understand impacts of phosphate starvation on plant 
growth? Would you like the instructor to spend more time going over statistical 
analysis in class?), if events outside the classroom are impacting their focus 
or performance inside the classroom (e.g., What concerns or worries do 
you have about being engaged in an online research experience compared to 
an in-person research experience?), or both. Consistently checking in with 
students allows you to cultivate a learning environment of respect and trust. 
When our experiential learning program went online due to the pandemic, 
I queried the students before the start of the program to get an idea of 
the level of plant science experience they had coming in and any concerns 
they had for the program. While we knew we could not control all of the 
concerns or comments that our students raised in the survey, making an 
effort to address the concerns that were within our control was important 
to build trust and openness with our students. In addition, every week 
students completed a short survey that included specific questions about the 
week’s content and space for students to leave any questions or concerns 
anonymously. Consistently, students asked for more lectures and tutorials 
on one of their projects, so we added weekly tutorials to take the students 
through each step of that project. If your program or course is online or even 
hybrid, consider making time for students to gather to work in groups or 
socialize. The physical distancing and lack of social interaction that virtual 
learning brings can lead your students, especially first-year students, to feel 
disconnected and lonely. Use weekly meetings as an opportunity to check 
in and discuss how they are really feeling. Create space, whether in current 
meetings or coffee hours where students can gather, chat and socialize. 
Encourage your students to prioritize their mental, emotional and physical 
health—even acknowledging current struggles and emphasizing their health 
as the priority can be helpful.

Conclusion 
Being the instructor of record for the first time is scary, and leading an 
experiential learning experience with its many moving parts can be even 
more daunting. I hope these three lessons I learned during my first summer 
of teaching can help you on your teaching journey!

10. The Power of Extension:
Research, Teaching, and Outreach
for Broader Impacts
JEREMY ELLIOTT-ENGEL; COURTNEY CRIST; AND GORDON JONES 
Introduction 
The land-grant university (LGU) system was created on a foundation of three 
missions: classroom-teaching, research, and a specific type of community 
education called Extension. The majority of this book has highlighted and 
focused on the formal higher-education classroom-teaching experience of 
the mission, and your doctoral program has provided training on the 
research component. This chapter will focus on the third mission, Extension 
(at non-LGU institutions similar efforts may be called outreach, engagement, 
or service). The Cooperative Extension System (CES) has a mission to 
translate research-based findings, best practices, and information in four 
broad program areas: youth development (4-H), agriculture and natural 
resources (ANR), family and consumer sciences (FCS), and community 
development (Seevers et al., 2007). Land-grant universities employ Extension 
educators to work from campus and state regional centers, as well as in 
local county or city offices to deliver Extension education programs based 
on stakeholder needs—including state, industry, and community needs

(Baughman et al., 2012). It should be noted that university and state 
Extension organizational structures and program priority areas differ by 
state. 
Extension educators offer nonformal educational programs to both 
businesses and the citizens of their communities. Local Extension educators 
are supported by research and Extension faculty across departments from 
the LGU. To start our journey to understanding what Extension education is, 
and how you, as a future or current LGU faculty member and researcher, will 
support Extension education, we will recount the history of the LGU mission, 
then introduce a learning theory for nonformal education, and finally explain 
the unique planning processes of Extension education programs. 
The objectives of this chapter are to provide a translation of effective 
teaching practices from the higher-education classroom and emphasize the 
interconnections of teaching and research disciplines to impactful 
community outreach, engagement, and impact. 
This chapter will discuss… 
• 
The origin and mission of the land-grant university system. 
• 
Educational theory utilized in non-formal educational 
settings. 
• 
Educational learning contexts and environments outside of 
the formal classroom. 
• 
How to establish and integrate a research, teaching, and 
outreach educational program to support broader impacts

What Is Extension? 
The use of the word “Extension” derives from an educational development 
in England during the second half of the nineteenth century. Around 1850, 
discussions began in the two ancient universities of Oxford and Cambridge 
about how they could serve the educational needs, near to their homes, 
of the rapidly growing populations in the industrial, urban area. It was not 
until 1867 that a first practical attempt was made in what was designated 
“university Extension,” but the activity developed quickly to become a well-
established movement before the end of the century. (Jones & Gartforth, 
1997, p. 1) 
The idea of Extension started in the late nineteenth century in both the 
United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (US) with three 
components: adult education, technology transfer, and advisory services 
(Shinn et al., 2009). In the United States, the development of the Extension 
system started on July 2, 1862, when President Abraham Lincoln signed 
the Morrill Land-Grant College Act (Morrill Land-Grant Act, 1862). This 
legislation forming the LGU system was sponsored by Vermont Senator 
Justin Smith Morrill. Passage of the Morrill Act was unexpected because 
President James Buchanan had previously vetoed a version of the act in June 
1860 due to Southern state representatives’ criticisms that granting Western 
territorial land was an imprudent use of resources. The Western territorial 
lands were lands taken from Native Americans by the US government. The 
bill that was vetoed had granted just 2,000 acres for a university’s setup. 
The successful version of the Morrill Act granted 30,000 acres of Western 
territorial land as an endowment to establish at least one college per state 
and territory (Wessel & Wessel, 1982). The Morrill Act successfully passed 
in 1862 largely because Southern states representatives were absent from 
Congress at the time of the vote due to the Civil War (Lee, 1963). 
The established purpose of the LGU institutions is to make liberal and 
practical education available to all citizens of the nation, particularly the 
working class (Duemer, 2007; Depauw & McNamee, 2006; Lee, 1963; Simon, 
1963). To achieve this mission the Morrill Act and its successors were 
deliberately designed not simply to encourage, but to force the states to 
significantly increase their efforts on behalf of higher education. The federal 
government, having promoted the establishment of new colleges, made it 
incumbent upon the states to supply the means of future development and 
204  |  The Power of Extension
expansion (Lee, 1963, p. 27). The LGUs married the humanistic idea of the 
renaissance university (liberal education) and the German university 
(practical education) (Bonnen, 1998). This combination of liberal and 
practical education in one institution was designed to democratize 
education and provide educational opportunities for all citizens. The LGUs 
evolved into entities with a three-pronged mission of research, teaching, and 
outreach (Simon, 1963). 
In 1890, a second Morrill Act was passed, which prohibited the distribution 
of money to states that made race a consideration when making decisions 
about admission to their state’s 1862 LGU institution (Lee & Keys, 2013). Each 
state had to demonstrate that race was not a criterion when considering 
a student’s admission to the LGU. If Blacks or other persons of color were 
unable to be admitted because of race, then a separate LGU was established 
for them (Comer et al., 2006). This resulted in 19 previously slave-holding 
states establishing public colleges serving Blacks (Allen & Jewell, 2002; 
Provasnik et al., 2004; Redd, 1998; Roebuck & Murty, 1993). These “1890” 
institutions were awarded cash in lieu of land; however, they retain the 
designation of “land grant” due to the legislation. The 1890 institutions 
brought public and practical education to previously excluded and 
marginalized populations.

University of Puerto Rico, University of the Virgin Islands, University of Guam, 
Northern Marianas College, College of Micronesia, and American Samoa Community 
College, all 1862 institutions, are not shown. 
In 1994, the Equity in Educational Land-Grant Status Act established 29 
tribal colleges and universities as “1994” tribal land-grant institutions. These 
institutions have a mission to provide federal government resources to 
improve the lives of Native American students through higher education 
(USDA-NIFA, 2015). 
The three current missions of research, teaching, and outreach were 
achieved through additional legislation. The 1887 Hatch Experiment Station 
Act (Hatch Act) established the State Agricultural Experiment Station (SAES) 
to improve agricultural production through applied agriculture research and 
to provide educational outreach opportunities through the LGUs (Knoblauch 
et al., 1962). Joining the locally responsive research from the SAES with 
the LGUs expanded the capacity for classroom education and provided the 
opportunity to share knowledge onsite at research stations across each 
state. However, to extend the positive benefits of knowledge farther afield, 
more efforts were needed. Cooperative Extension began when President 
Woodrow Wilson signed the Smith-Lever Act into law on May 8, 1914. The 
206  |  The Power of Extension
purpose of Extension was declared to be an effort “to aid in diffusing among 
the people of the U.S. useful and practical information on subjects related 
to agriculture and home economics, and to encourage the application of 
the same” (Rasmussen, 1989, p. 7). The Smith-Lever Act did not specifically 
state that Extension services should only work with farmers (Ilvento, 1997; 
Rogers, 1988). Extension was designed to take the research-based knowledge 
generated at the LGUs and the SAES to US citizens through a partnership 
between LGUs and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). 
The implementation of this organizational system had significant and 
profound effects on adult education in the United States. Liberty Hyde 
Bailey, a renowned botanist and Cornell faculty member, was instrumental 
in the formation of the Extension service and 4-H; he argued that Extension 
could not address agricultural production issues without also addressing the 
social and human issues facing rural communities (Ilvento, 1997; Rosenberg, 
2015). At the time, he lost the argument to Seaman Knapp, then president 
of Iowa Agricultural College, who laid the foundation of the Agricultural 
Experiment stations as an employee of the USDA. Knapp argued the role 
of Extension was solely to educate reluctant farmers on new technology 
(Ilvento, 1997; Peters, 1996). Because of Knapp’s influence, the purpose of 
Extension began as instruction and practical demonstration concerning 
agriculture and home economics for individuals in communities across the 
state who would otherwise not have access to information and new 
innovations. 
The name Cooperative Extension emerged from the cost sharing, which 
required using state and local funding sources to match the funds 
contributed by the USDA. Currently, federal partners supply approximately 
30 percent of the system’s financial resources, while state and local (e.g., 
county) funds make up the remaining portion of the budget (Rasmussen, 
1989). Further, following funding trends within higher education, a growing 
share of Extension budgets consists of extramural grants and contracts 
(Jackson & Johnson, 1999). 
The focus of US Extension work has evolved from primarily relaying 
technical innovation to also providing leadership for social, cultural, and 
community change and development (Stephenson, 2011) by partnering with 
communities to identify solutions to challenges in partnership (Vines, 2017). 
As previously mentioned, this adaption reflects a move toward Bailey’s 
perspective that community programming cannot provide technical 
knowledge without first supporting the individual and social needs of the 
The Power of Extension  |  207
participants. Extension, because of the nature of the organization, has always 
engaged with communities, and more importantly, has acted as an accessible 
and knowledgeable resource for the communities they serve. Extension 
professionals have sought to respond to society and community needs, 
whether in response to supporting a reduction of poverty in rural 
communities (Rogers, 1988; Selznick, 2011) or helping the nation survive 
World War I, the Great Depression, and World War II (Rasmussen, 1994) 
by ensuring the sustainability of food resources, and by supporting rural 
electrification (Rosenberg, 2015), rural telephone, and today, broadband 
access (Whitacre, 2018). The mission of Extension has expanded from a 
focus on agriculture and family and consumer sciences to incorporate areas 
of health, community, and business development, and from solely rural 
audiences to rural, suburban, and urban communities (Morse, 2009; DePauw 
& McNamee, 2006). While work remains to be done, 1862 LGUs in every state 
and territory work to serve a demographically representative population and 
address community challenges (Elliott-Engel, 2018), and 1890 and 1994 LGUs 
target historically underserved populations with specific interventions. 
What Is Extension Education? 
Early practitioners of … Extension education drew from foundational 
theories of learning and teaching (Dewey, 1938; James, 1907; Lancelot, 1944). 
During the early evolution, knowledge was grounded in observation and 
experience and passed to others through direct engagement methods. Over 
time, …Extension education integrated the principles of learning and 
teaching, applied research, and Extension outreach. Today’s field of study 
draws from educational psychology and the works of Bandura (1977), Bruner 
(1966), Gagné (1985), Knowles (1975), Piaget (1970), Thorndike (1932), Vygotsky 
(1978), and others. Perspectives of learning rise from the educational theories 
of behaviorism and constructivism, while the perspectives of teaching are 
drawn from the works of Freire (1972), Habermas (1988), Kolb (1984), Lewin 
(1951), and others who advanced problem solving, critical thinking, and 
communicative reason. (Shinn et al., 2009, p.77) 
208  |  The Power of Extension
Extension is an organization that continuously plans, executes, and 
evaluates programs with learners (Meena et al., 2019, p. 17) and updates or 
modifies as needed. Extension education is a knowledge exchange system 
that engages change agents in a participatory persuasive process of 
educating stakeholders in a changing world (Shinn et al., 2009). Extension 
educators are professionals in the social, behavioral, and natural and life 
sciences who use sound principles of teaching and learning, and they 
integrate the sciences relevant for the development of human capital and for 
the sustainability of agriculture, food, renewable natural resources, and the 
environment (Shinn et al., 2009). 
Extension education can be conducted and executed in many forms 
including in-person education (e.g., workshops, seminars, demonstrations, 
short courses), publication (e.g., website, print media), and using social media 
(e.g., infographics). In many non-LGU institutions, Extension is commonly 
referred to as community outreach or engagement. These terms originated 
in the Extension education movement. The work, when adopted, contributes 
to the democratic process of encouraging institutions of higher education 
to help extend research efforts beyond the students in the classroom and 
fellow researchers in academe to communities or businesses where it can be 
directly applied. 
There are several principles that are important to keep in mind to ensure 
success in extending research and knowledge outside the higher education 
environment. The education of community members has different principles 
than the formal education setting. In formal education settings, motivation 
is incentivized by earning grades needed to receive certification through 
the earning of a degree. In nonformal education settings, education centers 
around learners’ motivations to obtain the knowledge being offered and its 
impact on their livelihood or success. 
Nonformal Education Theory 
Nonformal education is the learning instruction provided beyond the 
traditional secondary education system designed to prepare individuals 
(adolescents and adults) to achieve their personal, social, and economic 
life goals (Okojie, 2020). When extending their research beyond the formal 
The Power of Extension  |  209
classroom, the educator becomes an adult and nonformal educator, also 
known as an Extension educator. Extension educators remain intentional 
and systematic while also recognizing content can and should be adapted for 
different clientele (Etling, 1993). 
Researchers have defined adult learners in overlapping but somewhat 
different ways. Merriam (2008) describes adult learners as those whose age, 
social roles, and self-perception define them as adults. Adult learning theory 
is informed by foundational scholars in related fields such as psychology 
and sociology. The theories of behaviorism, cognitivism, humanism, 
constructivism, and connectivism illuminate different learner types and their 
disposition toward the process of education (Balakrishnan, 2020). The main 
ideas, approaches, and contributions of these theories have been 
summarized for your reference in table 10.1. The denotation of the theory, 
approach, and application is indicated by the theorists’ major works and 
forthcoming implications.

Each theorist presents a systematic explanation for the observed facts and 
laws that relate to a specific aspect of life (Williamson, 2002), in this case 
the nonformal learner. Each of the theorists allows the Extension educator 
to conceptualize the learner in different ways. The nonformal learners bring 
their lived experiences, and thus, their varied motivations to the educational 
process. The educator in the nonformal context must think about barriers 
to participation and adoption (Rogers, 2003) of the practice or materials 
presented. 
Nonformal Education Is Present Everywhere 
The nonformal educator views all contexts and environments as a possible 
classroom and everyone as a possible student. The educator working with 
or through Extension (Extension Educator) has the flexibility to extend 
research and technical knowledge across many meaningful educational 
strategies (Fordham, 1979). The variety of strategies provides the Extension 
educator much greater flexibility, versatility, and adaptability than their 
formal classroom educator counterpart to meet the diverse learning needs 
of each clientele, and to adapt as those needs evolve (Coombs, 1976). 
Education can happen within numerous contexts. Common educational 
strategies for Extension education can be broken into three broad 
categories: An Extension educator can support a learner’s knowledge change 
through (1) face-to-face programming, (2) print, and (3) social media. Each 
approach has unique considerations for teaching and learning across areas 
of content, which are discussed below. 
Face-to-Face 
Many methods exist for engaging learners in person, and each uses a 
different approach to disseminating research. Clientele and subject matter 
will largely drive the type of face-to-face instruction. While many of the 
same teaching strategies for formal education can be applied in the 
nonformal educational setting, it is important to note the differences. For 
The Power of Extension  |  213
example, in most Extension programming, you will not assign homework 
and will not be giving graded assignments. Also, your learners need to be 
engaged with real-world relevance—this should also happen in a formal 
education setting, but sometimes this connection is forgotten. Learners 
also bring their own lived experiences and expertise into the learning 
environment. Many different strategies can be implemented and each has a 
different educational approach. 
The in-person strategies vary from one-on-one training or consulting 
to large format training, to groups of learners co-developing knowledge, 
or applied hands-on demonstrations. You will notice that each of these 
teaching and learning modes connect to the theoretical constructs of 
learning in table 10.1. 
Direct client support, such as technical assistance, is a large component 
of Extension specialists’ responsibilities. Stakeholder needs can vary with 
program area or content. Often, in specific circumstances, specialists may 
visit clients at their operations to assist directly with troubleshooting, 
system improvement, pilot testing, or optimizing methods. Extension has a 
rich history of disseminating information and teaching best practices to the 
stakeholders they serve. Each discipline may have a different approach or 
structure for assisting clients. Client assistance is largely dependent on the 
client’s current state and needs. As an example, food science (family and 
consumer sciences) provides a wide array of services to clientele including 
food safety consultation on process deviations, interpretation of laws, 
labeling review, educational information, shelf-life information, product 
analysis, food safety training, and meeting the requirements for processing 
and selling food. 
214  |  The Power of Extension
Diversity 
The work of Extension provides an opportunity for educating and 
connecting with all of society in a state and/or local region rather 
than solely those connected to higher education. It is important to 
develop Extension programs and supporting materials that are 
inclusive of the broad range of human experiences, cultures, 
resources, and identities, and to be sensitive to the systemic 
disadvantage that many groups have experienced (Farella, Moore, et 
al., 2021). We should strive to remember that programs which have 
historically been offered by the Extension Service were designed to 
cater to the needs of the majority, and that we have a responsibility 
to design—or redesign—our Extension programs to be equitable and 
meet the needs of everyone (Farella, Hauser et al., 2021; Fields, 
2020). Careful assessment of the needs of the communities we serve 
and, in many cases, further understanding for ourselves as 
educators, are required to develop inclusive, accessible, and 
culturally sensitive programming. 
Extension provides services such as seminars, training, continuing 
education, and certifications for clients ranging from producers to general 
public interest. Extension has and provides the subject matter experts to 
deliver these training and educational opportunities in diverse content 
areas. Further, Extension often has a public reputation for disseminating 
reliable information without bias. Training may be presented in collaboration 
with state and/or federal regulatory agencies or may be provided to meet 
regulatory standards and requirements outlined by governing agencies. For 
example, American National Standards Institute (ANSI) certification (e.g. 
ServSafe, Safe Plates), Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs), related 
certifications of Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), and Hazard Analysis 
The Power of Extension  |  215
Critical Control Point (HACCP) trainings and certifications are required by 
regulatory agencies depending on the sector of the industry. In agriculture, 
Extension educators deliver programs which provide continuing education 
credits for pesticide applicators and programs like Beef Quality Assurance 
for livestock producers. Extension specialists and personnel/agents often 
offer these training and certifications as part of their programmatic planning 
in a way to serve stakeholders. Extension trainers may need additional 
training and experience to certify participants and lead state training 
sessions. 
Similar to research collaborations, Extension educators also collaborate 
with colleagues in other states, counties, departments, and universities to 
diversify and expand programmatic efforts to a wider audience. Expertise 
among state Extension systems can vary and collaboration allows for better 
programming that serves both stakeholders and Extension educators. and 
Additionally, within the university, course collaborations are useful as clients 
may need topic diversity. Generally, entrepreneur series include speakers 
from across departments (i.e., varied subject areas) as well as topics to 
provide a general introduction to the subjects. 
Using the Food industry  as an example, subject matter experts represent 
agricultural economics, government/regulatory agencies, marketing, food 
safety, and business (Crist & Canales, 2020). These programs provide 
stakeholders a foundation of information as well as contacts in the event 
they need further assistance in that specific subject area. Recently, Extension 
program delivery has shifted toward using more online educational 
platforms, certification programs, expert happy hours, and “lunch and learn” 
series in order for stakeholders to access the information they need as well 
as provide a forum for questions. 
Extension specialists–faculty with a content area focus– can provide 
programmatic and subject matter competency in-service opportunities and 
training to Extension agents–county-based Extension professionals. 
Inservice training is considered continuing education and an opportunity 
to increase subject matter competency. Further, agents select the programs 
that they will deliver in the county. Specialists provide in-service training 
to agents so they may deliver these programs as intended and/or provide 
additional insight to the execution of the program. Inservice opportunities 
can include many topics and range in subject matter from youth 
216  |  The Power of Extension
development to agriculture and natural resources. Further, inservice training 
is provided throughout the year and on different education platforms 
including webinars, face-to-face training or lectures, and online platforms. 
Syllabus Development 
As Extension educators, it is important to make connections for 
students in traditional education to career paths and opportunities. 
As a group, Extension educators need to advocate and share their 
stories and passion with audiences that may not be familiar with the 
unique career opportunities of Extension, as most will associate 
higher education with the pillars of research and teaching. Some 
students may be familiar with part of Extension either through 4-H 
involvement or by having parents who were involved in educational 
offerings (e.g., master gardener). You can strengthen the connection 
of careers in Extension by incorporating assignments, 
presentations, and curriculum development into courses. 
Additionally, your institution may have Extension apprenticeship 
programs. These types of programs can be a valuable opportunity 
for students to learn more about the day-to-day Extension roles 
while at the same time impacting their communities. Integrating 
some of our communication pathways into syllabi or student 
experiences will expose them to the multifaceted world of 
Extension.

Community of Practice 
The Communities of Practice (CoP) framework is constructed from the 
exchange of a group of people who have a shared interest and want to 
improve on that interest using regular interactions with each other to 
accomplish that development (Wenger, 1998). Lave and Wenger (1991) 
introduced CoP to provide a template for examining the learning that 
happens among practitioners in a social environment comprising both 
novices and experts. Newcomers use this exchange between these 
populations to create a professional identity. Wenger (1998) then advanced 
the focus of CoP to personal growth and the trajectory of individuals’ 
participation within a group (i.e., peripheral versus core participation). No 
matter the purpose of educational outcome, CoPs can be designed 
intentionally, fostered informally, or identified after they have developed 
organically. A CoP can also be an outcome from learning experiences (Elliott-
Engel & Westfall-Rudd, 2018) that result from your strategy and lead to 
connecting people, providing a shared context, enabling dialogue, 
stimulating 
learning, 
capturing 
and 
diffusing 
existing 
knowledge, 
introducing collaborative processes, helping people organize, and generating 
new knowledge (Cambridge et al., 2005). 
A great example of direct client support (and farm model training), as well 
as being the foundation of the Extension service, is boll weevil eradication. 
The boll weevil was an invasive insect pest that was devastating cotton crops 
throughout the South in the early 1900s. Seaman Knapp, who has been 
mentioned previously, was sent to Mississippi by the USDA to help find a 
solution to the boll weevil infestation. Knapp set up an experimental farm 
to demonstrate to growers’ methods for mitigating the boll weevil damage. 
The farm opportunity became the model for agricultural demonstration 
(Mississippi State University Extension Service, 2020; Palmer, 2014). Similar 
stories exist for other areas and educational formats. For example, the 
foundation of family and consumer sciences began with home-
demonstration clubs that focused on improving nutrition and living 
conditions for rural families. These sessions continue today and address a 
variety of topics such as nutrition, cooking, health, mental health, financial 
literacy, volunteer programs, and home-based businesses (Mississippi State 
University Extension Service, 2020). 
218  |  The Power of Extension
Print Communications 
Print media is an important form of education delivery we often think of 
as andragogy rather than pedagogy. Most, if not all of us, have heard the 
phrase “publish or perish” in reference to faculty roles. This colloquialism 
emphasizes that print formats of education are highly valued in the academe. 
Yet, not all forms of print publication are equivalent or have the same 
credibility (e.g., burden of peer review), and thus their value is weighted 
differently by the institution’s Promotion and Tenure review board. 
A successful Extension educator should formulate a plan of distribution 
that includes each level of communication. Figure 10.2 provides a framework 
for you to think through how you can take your research findings and 
translate these specific findings into all forms of print communication. An 
Extension educator should provide multiple communication formats to 
ensure that the research done on campus is communicated to the citizens of 
the state they serve. 
Figure 10.2 Academic production by possible population reach and promotion and 
tenure value. 
It is unfortunate that social media and electronic options give the greatest 
reach for distributing research findings to a large audience and yet are 
weighted the least. Social media and other digital forms of publication are 
hard to evaluate for impact as well as implementation and/or behavior 
change. It would be easy to become hyperfocused on submitting 
publications to journals with a high-impact factor because that is what is 
favored for promotion. Yet, in Extension, we must ask, what is the value 
The Power of Extension  |  219
of creating new knowledge if it stays within the walls of the ivory tower? 
Extension’s purpose and mission is disseminating research-based evidence 
to improve the lives of the stakeholders they serve. 
Social Media 
Social media may not be commonly viewed as a pedagogical tool or accorded 
traditional forms of value in academe. However, it is a tool for rapidly 
spreading knowledge and its reach is hard to ignore in current society. Social 
media has evolved our consumption of both information and entertainment; 
it has also changed our preferences on how to consume new information 
(Subramanian, 2018). The use of social media provides the greatest 
opportunity to distribute research findings to a wide audience and to affect 
social discourse both positively and negatively. The field of science 
communication is rich, filled with best practices for effective outcomes, 
including language, strategy, and design. We won’t address those strategies 
here, yet we do want to emphasize the need to use and engage with social 
media and to view it as a platform for teaching. (For further reading on 
science communication, we recommend Laura Bowater & Kay Yeoman’s 
Science Communication: A Practical Guide for Scientists, New York: Wiley, 
2012.) 
In Conclusion: Extension Is a Bridge 
Extension activities should be viewed as a bridge to enhancing and 
expanding the reach of research-based evidence and technical information 
from members of academe to stakeholders in need. Faculty who hold 
Extension appointments should funnel energy into sharing their findings to 
the betterment of society. Many grants and funding opportunities require 
a broader impact statement, outreach, expected outcomes, and evaluation 
component and approach. This is where Extension professionals should 
shine and can use their expertise to develop methods for reaching and 
educating the audience where the findings will be most impactful. The 
220  |  The Power of Extension
“traditional” researcher may overlook this area of importance, but many 
funding agencies are placing higher priority on proposals that address how 
the grant will impact or improve the affected stakeholders. The next chapter, 
“Program Planning for Community Engagement and Broader Impacts,” will 
further discuss how to develop and translate knowledge to benefit 
stakeholders. 
Powerful and impactful teaching is rarely confined to the classroom. The 
Extension system and nonformal education are valuable for early career 
faculty members and graduate students. We hope that you will integrate 
the educational approaches from nonformal educational settings into your 
classroom and engage your learners with issues relevant to our 
communities. 
Not every reader will be an Extension specialist or a county-based 
Extension professional (a.k.a., Agent), nor will every reader even work at 
an LGU. However, all faculty have the motivation, if not the obligation, to 
share findings from your research agenda to the public. Many times this 
outreach is labeled as “broader impacts” (Donovan, 2019). We hope this 
chapter helps you see how your teaching and research can become integral 
to your community. If you are a graduate student seeking a position in 
higher-education, we hope this chapter has raised your interest in Extension 
education at LGUs or in developing better ways to communicate your ideas 
about how to bring community-relevant research and teaching to your 
research agenda. 
If you are reading this while working or studying at a LGU institution 
we hope this chapter has raised your awareness of the mission of your 
institution, and that you will seek out Extension professionals to help you in 
your teaching, research, and outreach efforts. If you do become an Extension 
specialist, or a county-based 4-H professional, congratulations! You are in 
for a challenging and rewarding career. We hope this chapter serves as a 
framework for conducting excellent Extension education programming and 
provides a greater awareness of the organization’s beginnings, the theory 
that frames the work, and some basic practices of non-formal education that 
you can use to maximize community outreach efforts.

11. Program Planning for
Community Engagement and
Broader Impacts
JEREMY ELLIOTT-ENGEL; COURTNEY CRIST; AND GORDON JONES 
Introduction 
Good teaching in higher-education doesn’t solely occur in the formal 
classroom setting. Thus, the objective of this chapter is to help graduate 
students and early career faculty to plan effective education in a community 
setting, particularly through Extension education efforts. While this chapter 
will discuss Extension programs it will be relevant for individuals who want 
to extend their research through community engagement to achieve 
broader impacts. 
Extension educational programs can include both individual workshops 
and larger coordinated efforts that comprise a Program. Fordham (1979, p. 
1) wrote “‘responding to needs’ as rapidly as possible is often the major 
justification for creating individual programs;” while there are many 
developments in praxis of program planning, this approach remains very 
common in practice (Gagnon et al., 2015). Yet, there is a risk of running from 
program to program —or need to need—as an Extension educator. If this 
is the educators method they will be busy and overwhelmed without any 
demonstrable impact (Arnold, 2015).

228  |  Program Planning
This chapter will discuss… 
• 
The principles of program planning. 
• 
Program planning factors including community needs and 
relationships. 
• 
The principles of program planning in community context. 
• 
How to make community impacts through research and 
teaching. 
Any educator can succumb to the urge to respond in the moment and lose 
sight of the long-term goals. So, how does the Extension educator find 
intentional purpose and stay focused on the overarching goal? They plan. 
The commonly accepted program planning model consists of six aspects 
(Cafarella, 2002; Cummings et al., 2015; Sork & Newman, 2004): 
1. Planning Table: Analyze planning context and client systems 
2. Needs assessment: Assess needs 
3. Logic modeling: Develop program objectives 
4. Formulate instructional plan: Prepare to teach across many modes 
5. Formulate administrative plan: Prepare to implement and utilize 
relationships to plan 
6. Evaluation: Design a program evaluation plan 
It is important to note that while these steps are presented in a sequential 
order, they rarely occur linearly in practice (Arnold, 2015; Houle, 1996; Morell, 
2010; Netting et al., 2008). 
Program Planning  |  229
Analyze Planning Context and Client Systems 
Extension educators, even more than classroom educators, need to 
understand the social and political context of their work. Extension 
educators conduct their work in local communities and engage with diverse 
and established ideals and knowledge. Understanding the political context 
of program delivery is important because, although community education 
work can increase political capital (Place et al., 2019), educators and the 
organization can also experience backlash (Elliott-Engel, Westfall-Rudd, 
Seibel et al., 2021). Recognition of the social context allows the educator to 
navigate appropriate partnerships and messaging. Further, each community 
and audience has cultural differences. The Extension educator must be 
sensitive to cultural differences in their many forms, not only differences 
in demographics, but also in language, religious affiliation and spiritual 
practice, values, and family and kinship patterns (Fields, 2020). The 
Extension educator must design and implement education that is responsive 
to these differences and engages these learners (Sork & Newman, 2004).

Assess Needs 
Training needs assessment is an ongoing process of gathering data 
to determine what training needs exist so that training can be 
developed to help the organization accomplish its objectives. … 
Often, organizations will develop and implement training without 
230  |  Program Planning
first conducting a needs analysis. These organizations run the risk 
of overdoing training, doing too little training, or missing the point 
completely. (Brown, 2002, p. 569). 
Once you are familiar with the planning context and client systems they 
will frame your ability to collect data in order to inform your understanding 
of your community needs. A needs assessment is essential to ensure the 
effectiveness of your Extension education efforts (Angima et al., 2014). Needs 
assessments are data driven and should help you identify gaps between 
current results and desired outcomes (for you and your community) and 
place the gaps in priority order (Kaufman et al., 1993). 
To begin your needs assessment you must first establish what you want 
to know that will inform your educational program design. This will define 
the data collected. The data you collect can and, in many cases should, be 
wide ranging (e.g., Census or publicly available economic data, interviews 
with key stakeholders, surveys of your target clientele, focus groups, or even 
the photovoice method (Wang & Burris, 1997)). This data collection should 
be rigorous and theoretically informed (Arnold, 2015). Using a theory of 
behavior change (refer to Table 10.1 in Chapter 10) your needs assessment 
data should help you delineate what you can do to respond to the needs of 
your audience. 
Make sure you maximize the effort you put into your needs assessment by 
publishing the process and/or the findings.

Assessment Guidebook for Extension Professionals by J. Donaldson and K.
Franck or Methods for Conducting an Educational Needs Assessment by
P. McCawley.
Develop Program Objectives 
Using your needs assessment you now have established a direction for your 
Extension education efforts (McLaughlin & Jordan, 2004; Taylor-Powell, & 
Henert, 2008). There are two levels for you to consider when developing 
learning objectives: There is the macro level of identifying the long-term 
changes you are trying to accomplish, and there is the learning objective of 
each of your educational workshops. Unfortunately, in Extension education 
vernacular, both are called programs. The first occasionally are referred to 
as “Big P programs,” while the latter are often called “little p programs,” We 
will use these terms for this discussion. 
Establishing objectives for your “Big P Program” takes on many of the 
characteristics of strategic planning. You will identify the long-term 
outcomes you want to see over time, and you will need to establish the many 
short-term goals necessary to accomplish these objectives. These plans 
should lead toward significant changes in society or in your organization 
(Elliott-Engel, Westfall-Rudd, & Corkins, 2021). These objectives are the 
overarching goals you have for your Extension work and will be the basis for 
all of your “little p programs.” 
For your “little p programs,” Extension educators have adopted the use of 
logic models (Israel, 2001; Taylor-Powell & Henert, 2008). The logic model is 
a sequential causal relationship tool. It allows an educator to connect theory 
of change with the objectives sought. However, many program logic models 
are built on the “assumption that new knowledge leads to attitude change, 
which leads to behavior change” (Patton, 2008, p.108). The sometimes 
simplistic program plans developed in Extension, when they are developed 
at all, focus on creating change without considering the pervasive systems 
in which that change happens and the influence the system can have on 
whether changes take place (Arnold, 2015; Arnold & Nott, 2010; Patton, 2008). 
232  |  Program Planning
At worst, logic models are developed based on erroneous assumptions and 
unsound theory, which leaves the measurement of program outcomes 
incapable of demonstrating program impact. 
Figure 11.2 Program Logic Model Framework. 
Of course, as a new educator you do not want to replicate the shortcomings 
of those who have come before. To improve logic model utilization, it is 
important to first consider which outcomes you want to achieve, and then 
identify the inputs you will need and what outputs you will develop. These 
outputs are your objectives. 
Figure 11.3 Example of a Program Logic Model for Reducing Pesticide Contamination to 
Surface Water 
Figure 11.3 shows an example of a program logic model related to pesticide 
application techniques and drift prevention. In a watershed in southern 
Oregon, a group of agricultural professionals, local organizations with a 
focus on water quality, Oregon State University Extension Service, and 
concerned citizens engaged with the Oregon Departments of Agriculture 
and Environmental Quality to monitor streams in the watershed for 
Program Planning  |  233
pesticide contamination. The water quality results indicated some pesticides 
were likely drifting into surface water from air-blast applications to orchards 
and/or vineyards. In developing the logic model, we worked backward from 
the long-term goal of reduced pesticide detections and developed learning 
objectives targeting specific drift reduction mechanisms. We delivered both 
classroom and hands-on programs and shared print materials to provide 
a range of learning opportunities. Through our follow-up evaluations, we 
learned that many producers in the region have adopted the recommended 
strategies, and we await further water quality results to determine the real 
environmental impact of our program. Taylor-Powell & Henert (2008) is a 
great resource to help you develop your own logic model. 
Syllabus Development 
In a formal classroom setting there are many ways to bring 
nonformal education into the syllabus; these include adding a 
community education component to a group project (i.e., creating a 
YouTube video or social media graphic, or presenting to a 
community partner). Asking a learner to teach their content is an 
excellent way to demonstrate content knowledge, help expose gaps 
in knowledge, and build a deeper understanding. In addition, you 
could partner with local Extension educators across the state to 
help students see how the issues they are learning about in the 
classroom are being experienced in other communities, or to learn 
how people are addressing the issues. These approaches can help 
you develop and prepare educational materials to support your 
Extension education agenda, and can also help make a real-world 
connection to the class topic for the learner. 
234  |  Program Planning
Formulate Instructional Plan 
Now that you have long-term objectives and know how to connect those 
objectives to your long-range goals, what should you teach, and in what 
format? Formulating your instructional plan should start with your learners 
in mind. Who are your learners? What do you know about their knowledge 
on the topic? And, of course what educational goals do you want to 
accomplish? 
Choosing what will be taught during a learning activity is a challenge 
because of time limitations, delivery modes, the varied backgrounds and 
experiences of the participants, materials available, and your own capability 
or style (Alessi & Trollip, 2001; Wlodkowski, 2008). To arrive at what is 
important, you can construct visual tools, such as a content map or outline. 
You can also talk it through with a colleague or knowledgeable stakeholder. 
Caffarella and Daffron (2013, pp. 185-186) encourage the Extension 
educator to think about the following questions as they formulate the scope 
of the teaching: 
•
What content is essential for learners to know and does this content
address one or more of the learning objectives?
•
What is the content that learners should know, which supplements the
essential material?
•
What is the content that might be interesting and relevant to the
essential materials, but will only be addressed as time allows?
•
What is the content that learners do not need to know (that is, it may
be useful but does not pertain to the learning objectives?
The above questions help the Extension educator set parameters of their 
content, just as a formal educator formulates a syllabus using similar 
objectives. Yet, the Extension educator also has to assess the framework 
for relaying the content. The Extension educator has many instructional 
techniques at their disposal. Earlier in the chapter, there was a discussion of 
the types of techniques the Extension educator will use to decide on which 
approach is most effective for learner knowledge change. 
Program Planning  |  235
The Extension educator can ask themselves the following questions for 
clarity: 
• What is your capability and preferred style of instruction? (e.g., your 
comfort facilitating) 
• What learning environment is most effective for the learners’ 
characteristics? (e.g., different ways of knowing) 
• What is the environment available to offer learning? (e.g., physical and 
virtual environments) 
• What additional learning resources are available to me? (e.g., print, 
video, hands-on projects) 
The nonformal learner should be valued for their possible contributions to 
the learning environment and co-creation of understanding and knowledge 
is an important assumption for the Extension educator. To do this the 
Extension educator will adopt teaching and learning opportunities that allow 
for knowledge transfer and discussion and opportunities to experience the 
phenomena being discussed (Moseley et al., 2019). Experiential learning is 
based on a theory of sociocultural experiences (table 11.1, refer to Kolb, 
Dewey, Piaget) and an educational philosophy which educators can adopt. 
Experiential learning can be a challenge for any educator, including the 
Extension educator. As you try out new techniques it is important to engage 
the learners in the process to prevent discomfort by the instructor or the 
learner. For example, you can choose to inform the learners that you are 
trying new techniques and would welcome feedback on whether they 
worked. Feedback can also be solicited in the form of written responses to 
open-ended questions at the end of the session. This allows both learner 
and educator to reflect on the process and establishes both individuals as 
valuable to the process.

Experience: Troubling Orthodoxies and Intersecting Questions by Tara J. 
Fenwick.

objectives is Planning Programs for Adult Learners: A Practical Guide by

236  |  Program Planning
Formulate an Administrative Plan 
An administrative plan is the behind-the-scenes frame for how to execute 
your Extension education efforts. Finally, a conversation about the planning 
is needed for implementation. As always, the better the plan, the better 
the outcomes (Mehta & Mehta, 2018). An administrative plan involves 
recognizing your available time commitment (job description and 
appointments), budgets, and resources (e.g., personnel) needed to 
implement the plan. 
Your Appointment and Job Description 
Your appointment and job description will determine how much Extension 
education you will conduct in your role. Even faculty with zero Extension 
commitment, however, would be remiss if they did not ensure their research 
has value to the broader society, especially to Land Grant University (LGU) 
faculty. We only have so many hours in a day, and there are many demands 
on a faculty member’s time, so Extension education efforts must be planned 
with your other commitments from research and teaching in mind. 
Extension efforts are, too often, an afterthought and are viewed as 
secondary or viewed as a second job on top of the teaching and/or research 
efforts. To be successful as a LGU faculty Extension education efforts should 
be embedded throughout your work and viewed as an important portion 
of your work to make a public impact. The more time and intentionality 
you invest in planning and informing your work with your needs assessment 
findings, the more likely you are to ensure your contribution to and impact 
on the stakeholders is maximized. 
Funding Your Extension Education Work 
In the higher education setting the ability to generate funding is increasingly 
important for professional success. No one will dispute that funding matters. 
It is important to keep in mind your big P objectives and little p opportunities 
Program Planning  |  237
when seeking funding. If you are clear about your goals, then you will be able 
to ensure grants are funding your efforts instead of your funding being your 
efforts. Being clear about what your audiences need and want is important as 
you seek funding to make your programs happen. First, you must know what 
your financial needs are to make your Extension education programming 
happen; second, you can discern what opportunities make sense to your 
goals; and third, you should think creatively about how a grant’s objectives 
intersect with your own. You will already be further ahead in your grant 
writing because you will have clear and well outlined objectives, informed by 
needs assessment data (that is hopefully published). 
Increasingly, federal granting agencies discuss the term broader impacts 
(Donovan, 2019). Broader impacts are those short- and long-term impacts 
that our communities realize because of the research conducted. Extension 
education efforts are always a portion of the broader impact conversation, 
although it is rarely specifically mentioned despite the relationship between 
Cooperative Extension and the federal government. An LGU faculty is in a 
unique position to be supported in these efforts because of the Cooperative 
Extension expertise of the LGU, and the network of county-based 
professionals across the state. 
Relationships 
Relationships are important for your success. We have all heard about the 
value of networking for professional success. Relationships are important 
within academia and throughout the community. Relationships and 
networks are informed by power, and planning for education is a negotiation 
between power and knowledge. Thus, forming an administrative plan is not 
a quotidian task. Rather, it is fraught with critical decisions that will have 
implications for you and the people you choose to educate. 
It will be important for you to think about the relationships that you 
build not only as social capital but as the opportunity to understand your 
educational context more effectively. Your relationships will be your access 
to new audiences and to ensure support for the programming you offer. 
These relationships will also inform the feedback you receive (Cervero & 
Wilson, 2001). 
238  |  Program Planning
The relationship between county agents and campus-based Extension 
specialists is fundamental to the functioning of both an Extension service 
and the LGU model. In agriculture and natural resources, as in the other 
program areas, the system functions at its highest level when there is rich 
interconnection between field and campus faculty. County agents serve as 
the front line in identifying new challenges and opportunities facing 
agriculture, forestry, and other managed ecosystems. When those 
challenges and opportunities are beyond the technical or logistical capacity 
of agents, Extension specialists help to provide expertise, grant-writing, and 
research support to ensure that clientele are well served. When an unknown 
insect, disease, or nutritional deficiency begins to show up on farms or a 
new crop or technology takes hold in a region or state, the benefits of 
having a network of faculty and agents becomes clear. County faculty will 
have direct, personal connections with local producers, will be a valuable 
resource in identifying those emerging needs, and can form a vital network 
of research partners to validate or demonstrate new practices across the 
state. Extension specialists will oversee or conduct the applied research to 
answer new or lingering questions, lead the development resources and 
Extension programs, and serve as subject matter experts for county faculty 
to rely on. The back-and-forth collaboration between county agents and 
Extension specialists is a keystone in delivering helpful and impactful non-
formal education and technical assistance to clientele. 
County agents (this title varies by institution) are often the front line of 
Extension and the heartbeat of the county as they serve state stakeholders 
and communities. In the event a client has a need or question, in some 
state Extension systems they are encouraged to directly contact the county 
Extension office first instead of a subject matter expert or Extension 
specialist. For example, in the Extension program area of family and 
consumer sciences (FCS), as in the other areas, specialists answer 
stakeholder questions through agents. Additionally, programming ideas may 
be derived from agent experiences or common questions that are received 
at the office. In other words, agents often identify gaps in programming 
and agents and faculty may work together to develop programming. Some 
programming may have different categories (e.g., agent-delivered, agent-
coordinated and specialist-delivered, specialist delivered). In agent-
delivered programs, agents are often trained to deliver the content (inservice 
Program Planning  |  239
training). Agents select these programs from a program of work that they 
deliver over the course of a year. Programs may vary in their time, duration, 
and number of meetings. 
The organizational structure of Cooperative Extension will vary by your 
LGU. To give you an example of how individuals across an LGU may work 
to support community education we share this example. At Mississippi State 
University specialists are expected to develop and manage at least one 
statewide program that agents may choose to offer in their counties. FCS, 
one of the core program areas, conducts programming that ranges from 
childhood development, finances, home economics, food safety, home food 
preservation, nutrition, exercise, etc. As an example, a home food 
preservation program was developed to serve state stakeholders when 
agents identified a gap in programming. Some agents have significant 
canning experience while others do not. While agents have the ability to 
conduct subject sessions in their county, only specialists can develop 
statewide programs; however agents can contribute and assist with the 
development. Home food preservation was developed in coordination with 
two county agents that have experience with home canning. The specialist(s) 
met with the agents to determine the sessions, lab activities, and program 
modules. Then the specialist developed the program and agents in the state 
pilot tested the program to work out content and guidance. 
Feedback is very important for the success and execution of a program, 
especially when lab activities are involved. Once the program is finalized, 
agents will select the program (if interested) and attend inservice training 
(competency) to learn the content and lab activities (hands-on). Agents will 
then conduct the program in their county with their interested stakeholders. 
Generally, there is an evaluation piece to assess knowledge change and 
competency. In closing, agents are invaluable resources and are experts in 
their ability to extend knowledge. As a Specialist, it is important to make 
agents who have client questions a priority as they are the “face” of 
Extension. Agents are a vital part of the team and developing relationships 
and rapport with them is essential to success. Remember that agents want 
to see you and you should be involved. 
No matter your area of expertise you will have varying levels of 
administration. For example, a county-based faculty member will have a 
County Director, and a Program Leader; a state level specialist will have a 
Department Head and a Program Leader. There may be other administrative 
structures depending on your university Extension organization (e.g., 
240  |  Program Planning
Regional 
Directors, 
Unit/Program 
leaders). 
Individuals 
in 
these 
administrative roles have the responsibility to inform you of your specific 
job duties, provide a supportive framework for your success, and serve as 
coach and mentor. Individuals in this role will help you navigate the many 
vagaries and pitfalls of the public interface and they should be viewed as a 
resource for program development. They have a different vantage point in 
the organization and may be able to connect you to your peers with similar 
work, or to other partners across the university, state, or country. 
Keeping your administrators aware of your work is important—the more 
they know about what you are working on the more then can help you be 
successful. However, updating your administrators about your programming 
should be done succinctly and with respect for their time and role. More is 
not always better. Be judicious and respectful about time and place. No one 
likes a hard sell, and that strategy can backfire. Also, going above someone’s 
head without notification is rarely appreciated. Higher education is a 
bureaucracy and as such you should navigate through the chain of 
command, not because you could get what you want by jumping levels this 
one time, but because administrators in higher education are long-timers 
and building the relationships and following the organization norms will help 
you go farther for the long-term. 
Partners 
Our fast-changing world means that we cannot have all the answers; 
especially when it comes to solving problems, we must collaborate. In 
addition to making our resulting outcomes more effective, working as a team 
is just plain more fun, and the research shows if teams are more cognitively 
diverse, then they also arrive at better solutions (Aggarwal et al., 2019; Olson 
et al., 2007). Your partners should 
•
complement your areas of job performance weakness,
•
bring new audiences to your program,
•
bring new perspectives to your program,
•
be responsible for the work they say they will do,
•
be professionals who you respect, and
•
be enjoyable to work with!
Program Planning  |  241
Your partnerships need to be authentic and reciprocal. Authentic 
partnerships are based on mutual respect and value for the person and 
organization even when there is no specific ask on the table. Reciprocal 
partnerships are based on mutual benefits. Do not confuse reciprocal with 
transactional (Burns, 1978). Reciprocity in successful partnerships is about 
working toward both parties’ best interests and being conscious about 
stewarding the relationship. 
Partners are also important in maximizing impact (Bryson, 2004); they are 
important for your Extension education capacity to maximize your outreach, 
but also for many other aspects of your professional needs, not limited to 
grantsmanship and research. Partners have different networks and different 
vantage points, thus as you select the people you choose to call your team, 
do so with intentionality and care. 
Balancing the Needs of So Many 
There are different community scopes for Extension educators. Some 
educators view their workspace as encompassing both national and 
international reaches; others see their target community as a whole state; 
while yet others  have a countywide or regional scope.  No matter the size 
of the target community you will inevitably be pulled in too many directions, 
and without both a clear commitment to your overall objectives and an 
administrative plan you may very well find yourself going from problem to 
problem feeling very busy but not accomplishing much. 
So, how do you find the right balance when there are so many demands? 
Your assessment of opportunities will need to be based on your overall Big 
P Program objectives and capacity for easy implementation of your little 
p. In theory this is easy to address, but it is incredibly hard to handle in
practice. When you are certain of your objectives and your administrative
plan you will have clear parameters to establish a framework for how to
assess your ability to meet those needs. The framework will help you choose
what opportunities you do want to get involved with or not when you are
asked to take on an additional project. The framework rooted in your
objectives and administrative plan will also give you language to explain
242  |  Program Planning
why you are making this choice even as you are pushed and pulled by 
stakeholders, clientele, administrators, and funders and even as you become 
excited about the possibilities of other work. 
As you balance the needs of so many people do not lose the forest for 
the trees. You will have a group of clients that become super users and will 
want a lot of your attention; this is a sign your program is valued. You will 
also want to ensure you are balancing the needs of both the many and the 
elite few high-profile clients. In a different instance of balancing service to 
different clients, we used the example of publishing. While publishing an 
article in a top-tier journal will be valuable for your promotion and tenure 
packet, if you have not also identified ways to ensure that new information 
is valuable to your community then you may have achieved one of your 
objectives, but you have lost sight of the long-range impacts of your work. 
The concept of program integrity, defined as the degree to which a 
program is implemented as originally planned, is the core of your 
programming implementation. As described by Dane & Schneider (1998), 
program integrity consists of five main dimensions: 
•
Adherence refers to how closely program implementation matches
operational expectations (Duerden & Witt, 2012).
•
Dosage represents the amount of a provided service received by a
participant (Duerden & Witt, 2012).
•
Quality of delivery deals with the manner in which the service was
provided (Dane & Schneider (1998).
•
Participant responsiveness measures individuals’ engagement and
involvement in the program (Domitrovich & Greenberg, 2000).
•
Program differentiation identifies program components in order to
ascertain their unique contributions to the outcomes (Dusenbury et al.,
2003)
Program Planning  |  243
Diversity 
Nonformal education program planning is about using intentional 
processes to ensure successful outcomes. Extension education is 
about extending the research-based information generated on 
campuses to community members. Therefore cross-cultural 
competency and understanding is fundamental to effective 
programming (Elliott-Engel, Westfall-Rudd, Seibel et al., 2021) and 
good program planning is essential. The Extension educator should 
be conscious of the many communities they are engaging with and 
take intentional steps to reduce barriers to information 
consumption (Intemann, 2009). Intentional interventions can 
include translating content and materials into appropriate 
languages in the communities they are reaching; ensuring graphics 
and other media are accessible to those with visual or hearing 
impairments; and tweaking program design to address the cultural 
characteristics of the communities you are working in (Farella et al., 
2021). Extension educators also need to establish expectations 
within their programming to ensure a welcoming environment for 
all participants. Gonzalez et al. (2020) identify that to be inclusive, in 
their case LGBTQ+ youth, Extension educators will need to focus 
inclusion efforts at multiple levels, including: systemic advocacy, 
guidance and protocols, programming, and professional 
development and dispositions. 
244  |  Program Planning
Bringing the Science to the People 
Extension (both service and outreach) education connects research and 
teaching missions of the land-grant university to the citizens of the state. 
The Extension educator can, and should, serve as the conduit for not only 
your own research, but also that of others from campus. The larger your 
Extension education appointment the more likely you will be in a role of 
helping extend someone else’s research to the community. When others 
are conducting research or submitting grants, Extension educators can be 
brought in as key partners. You want to position yourself with faculty across 
campus in your role of expert—both in your content knowledge and your 
skills as a translational communicator. 
Our universities are large bureaucracies, filled with many boundaries (or 
silos) between individuals. As Extension educators we should be trying to 
eliminate duplication of effort in extending research. Extension education 
work is translating research to the layperson, yet because individuals across 
our institutions are so often unaware of the land-grant mission, or the 
specifics of Extension, they end up reinventing the wheel. Do not recreate 
the wheel for extending knowledge. If you are an Extension educator, then 
keep up the advocacy for your mission and the value of the work you offer. 
Broader impacts are important, and Extension education can deliver these to 
communities across your state. 
Also, as an Extension educator, Extension is the original open access 
content. Extension materials can be adapted, updated, and used with your 
new audiences. Of course, make sure you give attribution for the original 
work and make sure it is updated for your purposes. 
Program Planning  |  245
Evaluation, Metrics, Defining Impact, and Use of 
Results 
It will be no surprise to anyone that evaluation is an important aspect of 
your Extension program. Evaluation is often overlooked, yet it should be the 
foundation of your program planning. You will not be surprised to learn that 
evaluation is regularly viewed as a chore, an afterthought, or the follow-up 
work. This is unfortunately the case for far too many educators; Extension 
educators are not exempt despite a considerable focus on evaluation by 
administrators and in program-planning training. This section of the chapter 
will not teach you how to evaluate, but it will give you a framework to think 
about how to implement and use evaluation data. 
By ensuring you have great learning experiences that are linked to learning 
outcomes, program conceptualization is the start of evaluation. Yet, 
Extension education has many different ways of measuring and 
conceptualizing impacts. While the Extension educator is of course 
interested in the learners’ knowledge change, there are also considerations 
for long-term behavior change, and the societal results when many 
individuals make similar changes. 
In order to build support for Extension, “public value stories and 
statements” (Chazdon & Paine, 2014; Franz, 2013) or “public good” (Franz, 
2011, 2013, 2015) are often used in place of the word “impact.” To measure 
indicators associated with impacts, an emphasis has been placed on 
evaluation (Cummings & Boleman, 2006; Franz et al., 2014). This is not a 
movement solely in Extension—it is also occurring across the public and not-
for-profit sectors. 
The impact on the individual learner is a private value. Private values 
(Lukes, 1973; Franz, 2011) are products and services that directly benefit 
private individuals and are consumed by those individuals. People typically 
access these products and services as paying customers in direct, voluntary 
economic exchanges. To evaluate private values, a pre- and post-survey 
strategy is effective at the point of delivery. Understanding learner 
knowledge change is the first evaluation building block. Follow-up to 
measure behavior change is needed after the training. 
246  |  Program Planning
The impact on the broader community is a public value. Public value is 
consumed collectively by the citizenry rather than individually by clients or 
customers. It includes things that economists call “public goods” which are 
“jointly consumed,” “non-rivalrous,” and “non-excludable” (Donovan, 2019). 
This means that one person can consume them without reducing their 
availability to another person, and also that nobody is excluded from 
consuming them—for example,e public parks, clean air, and national defense 
(Alford & Hughes, 2008; Moore, 1995). Metrics to measure public value 
(Franz, 2013) are needed. To communicate public value effectively you will 
need to find metrics that connect the individual knowledge change to impact 
(Haskell et al., 2019; Place et al., 2019). It is not uncommon for knowledge 
change and outcomes to be connected only theoretically (see Logic Model; 
Travis et al., 2018). 
The data we collect implicates the perceived value of our Extension 
education efforts. Figure 11.4 highlights that both individual and public value 
data can support public value perception, yet for stakeholders (in this case 
government funders) public value is placed above individual experience and 
individual good.

Evaluation is important in communicating the “why” of your program to 
funders and stakeholders. Figure 11.4 illuminates the importance of empirical 
data for supporting the relevance argument. Yet, as an Extension educator 
you will need to critically assess your own programming using evaluation 
data to inform the effectiveness of a program. You can use these data to 
adapt your program to ensure goals are being met or you can choose to 
discontinue a program because you are not seeing the returns you would 
expect or the return on investment that makes it worth the expenditure of 
time or money. 
Evaluation is a tool, one that should be embedded into your program 
model; the sooner you start incorporating an embedding evaluation into 
your program the more effective you will be.  The quality of your program 
will increase, and you will be more able to share how and why your 
programming is valuable. 
• An excellent resource for a deeper dive into program evaluation and 
assessment of public value is Program Evaluation Theory and Practice 
by Donna M. Mertens and Amy T. Wilson. 
• An excellent resource for assessing learner outcomes is The Reflective 
Educator’s Guide to Classroom Research by Nancy Fichtman Dana and 
Diane Yendol-Hoppey. 
• An excellent resource on understanding broader impacts is chapter 24, 
“Assessing the broader impacts of publicly funded research” by Claire 
Donovan in Handbook on Science and Public Policy. 
Focused Excellence and Impact 
After reading this chapter and this book, you may be completely 
overwhelmed with the many aspects of developing effective teaching, 
research, and Extension efforts. This is where your focused excellence 
comes in. Focused excellence is a framework for you to narrow, screen, 
and assess the many opportunities you are offered (Parrott et al., 2020). 
Only you can determine what your focused excellence will be, but your 
focused excellence should be the topic on which you want to be considered 
the expert, and the area you build support for through your research and 
248  |  Program Planning
Extension efforts. Focused excellence is targeted at a program in the 
Extension education context, such as childhood nutrition, 4-H youth civic 
engagement, or parasitic insects in livestock. These are examples of discrete 
categories that an Extension educator may choose as their area of focused 
excellence. Within this area you will use the program planning development 
model and establish focused objectives. To achieve focused excellence you 
will concentrate your attention on building depth and program quality in 
your programming rather than flitting from task to task and project to 
project. To achieve your own focused excellence you will develop strategies 
to maximize every effort for integrating research, teaching, and community 
education (a.k.a., Extension). The key to success is finding efficiency and 
optimizing opportunities to serve a dual role; this will not only benefit you, 
but will affect the impact and involvement of others. Extension education is 
a rewarding career path, where your work and effort directly impacts the 
community which you serve. 
Reflection Questions 
• 
Are you using an intentional program planning process in 
your community education efforts? 
• 
Who are your current stakeholders and what feedback do 
you use to establish your research and teaching priorities? 
• 
What do you do to maximize your efforts to spread your 
research to the community? And, how do you maintain 
focused excellence?

12. Personalized Advising that Is
Purposely Inconsistent: The
Constants of Great Advisors and
the Variability that Demands
Adaptability
WILLIAM MOORE 
Introduction 
Congratulations! You’ve earned your graduate degree and landed a job in 
academia. This in itself is quite a feat! Your mentors have helped prepare 
you to conduct your own research, secure extramural funding, and speak 
publicly about your research. Perhaps you’ve even had teaching experience 
or better yet, received some formal training in pedagogy. Your new 
supervisor mentioned in passing that you would be expected to serve as an 
academic advisor for some of your students. Piece of cake, you thought, all 
you need is a course catalog and a list of degree requirements, right? How 
hard can it be? 
A couple of weeks prior to the first day of class, you receive a list of 
advisees and appointment times from the registrar’s office. Reality sets in. 
You are in the hot seat. Maybe you’re confident. Maybe you’re a nervous

wreck as the weight of responsibility rests heavily on your shoulders. If you 
find yourself even somewhat in the latter category, allow me to remind you 
of the adversity you’ve already overcome. Your success to this point means 
that you have a recipe for success in your toolbelt, but perhaps you’ve been 
too busy writing your dissertation to think about it. 
This chapter will discuss… 
• 
Skills and characteristics of effective advisors. 
• 
How to develop and hone your own advising philosophy. 
• 
The merits and drawbacks of various advising techniques 
and strategies. 
The purpose of this chapter is not to provide an exhaustive explanation 
of advising techniques and sociological defenses for each one, but rather 
to help bring your recipe for success to the front of your mind; to serve 
as a companion as you take time to ponder the contents of and begin to 
articulate your recipe. Finally, I am here to offer some research-based advice, 
from a “been-there-done-that” standpoint, to help strengthen your advising 
philosophy and explore the merits of other techniques and strategies as you 
learn to tweak your recipe for success to meet the needs of an infinitely 
diverse student population. 
Before we dive into the content of this chapter, consider the following 
questions: What interpersonal skills and styles facilitate great advising? At 
which of these skills are you particular adept? Which of these skills could 
admittedly use work? How do you present yourself in such a way that your 
advisees recognize your warm, caring advisor heart? How do you train your 
ear to be one that listens and hears your students? Are any of the thoughts 
that have just crossed your prefrontal cortex more important than others? 
258  |  Personalized Advising
An entire book could be written on any of these topics. However, the goal not 
being to provide an exhaustive list, I urge you to consider these questions as 
you read these next few pages. 
Behaviors and Characteristics of an Effective 
Advisor 
While it has been reported that students tend to be most satisfied with the 
advising administered by an advising center staff compared to that offered 
by individual faculty (Belcheir, 1999a), it is understood that some readers 
work at institutes of higher education that do not provide their faculty 
with such an asset. Before moving on to discuss the various aspects of this 
section, note that personal experience has so far found it to be true that 
“you can only lead a horse to water,” so to speak. Research supports this 
observation in that extraverted students have reported to have perceived 
higher quality and more satisfying advising experiences than introverted 
students (Mottarella et al., 2004). The study also found that a majority of 
students, regardless of their personality, desire to establish warm and 
supportive relationships (Mottarella et al., 2004). This supports the rationale 
that advisors should take time to reflect on their own interpersonal skills and 
relationship-building approach, such that they are best suited to facilitate 
this warm and supportive environment. Thus, this chapter will focus on 
things that can be done and should not be done to strengthen the ability to 
“lead the horse to the water.” 
Approachability 
The introduction to this chapter mentions the weight of responsibility 
placed upon advisors. The purpose of its mention is twofold; (1) to strengthen 
their confidence by serving as a reminder that they’ve already overcome 
great adversity to get to the position they’re in and (2) to reiterate that 
advising is not a task to be taken lightly as it is critical for the academic 
success and personal development of the students (Amenkhienan & Kogan, 
Personalized Advising  |  259
2004; Latopolski, 2018). Student success is very much associated with the 
quality of advising. In a meta-analysis of studies on doctoral student attrition 
and persistence, the single most frequently occurring finding was that 
successful program completion is related to the degree and quality of 
contact between students and advisors (Centra, 2004). Warmth and support 
from the advisor have also been shown to be important factors in advisee 
satisfaction (Mottarella et al., 2004). For a warm and supportive interaction 
to occur, advisors must first position themselves in a way that invites 
interaction; in other words, advisors should consciously do everything in 
their power to make themselves approachable. 
Age Doesn’t Matter… But If It Does, New Faculty Have 
an Advantage 
While some advising techniques might require extensive time, dedication, 
and practice to master, rest assured that neither youth nor inexperience 
hinder approachability. One common misconception about advising is that 
those who have extensive teaching experience tend to make the best 
advisors. This can be refuted by noting that freshly minted products of 
higher education are more likely to be able to empathize with the students 
compared to more seasoned faculty. A study (Eberdt, 1968) aimed at defining 
selection criteria for secondary school counselors studied characteristics of 
secondary teachers who had been rated as most and least approachable by 
their students. Interestingly, the data indicate that teaching experience and 
even intellectual ability tend to impede approachability. In fact, personality 
factors are suggested to be as important, if not more so, than academic 
ability (Eberdt, 1968). More recently, it has been shown that student 
satisfaction with an advisor is more likely be dependent on the advisor’s 
interpersonal skills and style than on their advising approach (Mottarella et 
al., 2004). Indeed, research has shown that the advising climate is dependent 
on the extent to which an advisor provides facilitative conditions such as 
listening and hearing (Whiteley et al., 1975). 
260  |  Personalized Advising
Relationship Building Requires a Time Commitment 
Regardless of the advising approach, the establishment of a warm and 
supportive relationship can be foundational (Mottarella et al., 2004). Even an 
intrusive and/or prescriptive approach to advising (discussed later) does not 
require cold, unsupportive, uncaring advising (Mottarella et al., 2004). Also, 
despite it having been reported that students who have previously received 
academic advising tend to indicate that female advisors are typically more 
empathetic (Nadler & Nadler, 1993), this may be because female faculty have 
been shown to devote more time to advising than their male colleagues 
(Bennett, 1982). Thus, in addition to facilitating a warm and supportive 
advising environment, it is of paramount importance that an appropriate 
amount of time is devoted to advising. 
This begs the question, what sort of advising tasks should merit a 
significant time investment? An advising appointment can be likened to an 
exam. Time should be spent in preparation in order to ensure success; 
however, regardless of time spent preparing, if the actual process is rushed, 
it is easy to leave points on the table. In other words, it is important to 
allow ample time to engage with advisees. During an advising appointment, 
the advisee should be the focus of the advisor’s undivided attention. The 
following remarks by John Dewey (Dewey, 1938 p. 79) support this rationale: 
Once more, it is part of the educator’s responsibility to see equally 
two things: First, that the problem grows out of the conditions of the 
experience being had in the present and that it is within the range of 
the capacity of students; and, secondly, that it is such that it arouses 
in the learner an active quest for information and for production of 
new ideas. 
To put Dewey’s remarks in the context of advising, students/advisees exist 
in a certain social environment, and time should be taken to be cognizant of 
this in anticipation of the advising interaction. Further, it would be beneficial 
to spend a few minutes allowing the student to engage in a dialogue with 
the advisor about this context. Advisors must also take the time to ensure 
that any prescriptive tasks are within their advisees’ capacity to succeed. 
Finally, time should be spent helping students see the relationships between 
their academic milieu as well as the relationships that exist between this 
Personalized Advising  |  261
milieu and their goals. Such attention contributes to the intellectual growth 
of the student by pushing them to strive to be active learners and productive 
scholars in a broader context. 
If the reader is anything like the author of this chapter, this seems a 
daunting task. This work is being written from the perspective of a person of 
admittedly poor memory, especially pertaining to faces, names, and details 
about the lives of other people. Further, the author’s office epitomizes 
disorder. These personal flaws require extra steps to ensure that the 
approach to advising is organized so that time allocated for advising can be 
maximally invested in the advisee. 
First, I recommend that advising files/folders have a distinct color. It is 
helpful to only use this color folder for advising. There should also be a 
special place for advising folders and for all things advising. The contents 
of advising folders don’t have to be anything extraordinary. Keep it simple. 
Academic records, an updated program of study, and some minute profile 
information (i.e. career goals, extracurricular activities, likes/dislikes) is 
generally sufficient. However, a typically disorganized person might find it 
helpful to have a place in the folder to take notes that can be used to interact 
with the student both personally and academically. For example, seeing a 
student’s name in a school publication about some meritorious endeavor 
could be noted so that congratulations can be extended. If a student 
discloses any likes/dislikes (e.g., they hate art), make note of that. Further, 
interview notes regarding students’ career goals (this likely will be updated 
multiple times for most students) can be recorded here. This information 
can be used to build a personal relationship with each student, serving as a 
cornerstone for the Deweyan-inspired approach to guiding student learning 
during advising. 
Certainly, these things require an initial time investment, but they are 
incredibly valuable. Before every advising appointment, time should be spent 
reading through these notes, and jotting down any thoughts/concerns that 
should be discussed during the next appointment. Regardless of the 
method(s) used, it is imperative that enough time is allowed in the advising 
appointment to be able to engage with the student personally, allow the 
advisee to discuss their concerns and reason for the appointment, allow 
the advisor to discuss their concerns with the advisee, and emphasize how 
everything that has been discussed points towards the greater goal of the 
advisee’s calling. 
262  |  Personalized Advising
Disposition/Demeanor: “Why don’t you smile?” 
The word “approachable” is a descriptor for someone who is friendly, 
welcoming, and pleasant. What are some features of people who are 
“approachable”? 
Research in behavioral psychology has shown that there is a fundamental 
motivation to approach environmental aspects that apparently confer 
benefit and a fundamental motivation to withdraw from those that are 
apparently harmful (Schneirla, 1959). Rotteveel & Phaf (2004) showed that 
the perception of happy expressions resulted in arm flexion, which has been 
associated with positive information (Rotteveel & Phaf, 2004). In layman’s 
terms, this literature can be summarized with a common interrogative from 
a wise great aunt, often directed at her great nephew as a child; In her thick 
Southern accent, she’d ask “Honey, why don’t you smile?” 
The tendency to gravitate toward and away from certain facial demeanors 
is deeply ingrained in human nature. Even infants have been shown to 
gravitate toward their mothers when they are smiling, but not when they are 
frowning (Sorce et al., 1985). Assuming this primitive tendency is continuous 
throughout the human lifespan, it is certainly a worthwhile topic to cover 
in the pursuit of becoming more approachable to postsecondary students. 
Indeed, it has been suggested that smiles are useful in establishing and 
maintaining effective interpersonal relationships as they are indicators of 
trustworthiness and cooperative intent (Owren & Bachorowski, 2001). A 
more recent study showed that movement toward an approaching target 
was more likely when the target displayed a positive emotional state (Miles, 
2009), thus supporting the rationale that there is an active primitive 
tendency to gravitate toward facial expressions perceived as positive. 
Though initiating contact with a certain demeanor is a good starting point, 
please note that this is NOT a suggestion to always smile or put on any 
one set of “approachable” facades, but to rather consider them during 
interactions with people. For one, it is not inherent in everyone’s personality 
to always be cheerful or otherwise able to put themselves in a good mood 
on command. A cheerful demeanor can be forced to some extent, but human 
biochemistry is simply often not conducive to being in a good mood 24/7/
365. Further, it could be perceived as “fake” by students. Worse, this might
inadvertently lead a student to pursue academia under the false pretense
that such a career is all positive.
Personalized Advising  |  263
As important as all of these things are, it must be recognized that cultural 
differences must also be considered and accounted for. What is perceived 
as “approachable” may very well differ from person to person based on their 
background. For example, one study showed that Chinese participants relied 
more on the eyes to represent facial expressions while Western Caucasians 
tended to rely more on the mouth and eyebrows, suggesting that cultural 
distinctions might indeed cause a misinterpretation of an emotional 
portrayal during cross-cultural communication (Jack et al., 2011). In short, 
advisors should take time to get to their students in order to put themselves 
in the position to facilitate an environment that best supports their 
educational pursuits. 
Availability 
A study cited earlier in this chapter noted that students tend to prefer 
advising centers over peer counselors largely because the students 
perceived peer counselors as not being either proactive or available when 
needed (Belcheir, 1999b). It has been further shown that committed, 
purposeful communication with an advisor is associated with increased 
student motivation and involvement (Astin, 1999). Fielstein (1987) showed 
that 28.9% of students, when interviewed about their advising experiences, 
noted that their advisor’s personal acquaintance with them was a high 
priority (Fielstein, 1987). Not surprisingly, research collectively suggests that 
students tend to be most pleased with faculty advisors who are available and 
accessible (Alexitch, 1997). 
Access to and availability of faculty advisors is an area of concern as 
advising is an additional item on a plate already filled with quality teaching, 
research, committee work, outreach, and so on (Gnepp et al., 1980; Habley 
& Others, 1988). Complicating the issue is the fact that advising tends to 
be of low priority in tenure and promotion consideration processes (Habley 
& Others, 1988; Spencer et al., 1982). All of these things understandably 
culminate in reasonable faculty members simply NOT placing advising at 
the top of their priority lists. A 1987 ACT survey indicated that most faculty 
spent 1-5% of their time advising and that most faculty have contact with 
their advisees two or fewer times in an academic term (Habley & Others, 
1988). Sadly, this is a disservice to the students, resulting in many institutes 
264  |  Personalized Advising
of higher learning falling short of student expectations. Admittedly, one of 
the reasons for mentioning this seemingly obvious characteristic is based 
on personal conversations with students regarding their description of an 
ideal advisor. Almost all of them note some variation of “the advisor must 
be available” as the number one factor of importance in their assessment of 
advising. 
A student whose advisor is not accessible is missing out on the wealth 
of information and experience that the faculty advisor could provide if they 
were available/accessible. For example, a faculty member can usually 
provide detailed information about courses, programs, and (cough cough) 
other professors. They can also provide a rationale for a requirement and 
point students toward otherwise unknown career opportunities (Habley & 
Others, 1988). 
Education would be a far greater experience for students if only advisors 
who wanted to advise were allowed to serve in that capacity, and if those 
advisors were given some sort of relief of other duties to provide reasonable 
incentive for diligently serving in this highly important capacity. 
An individual tasked with academic advising is highly encouraged to recall 
their importance in the students’ success and to do everything they can to 
take an interest in their students. This includes taking the time to strengthen 
their advising skills. Perhaps the most simple thing that can be done is to BE 
AVAILABLE. This is not saying that every hour outside of the classroom has 
to be spent in the office, but that there is merit in being proactive about this. 
Advisors should post and keep office hours, and bend over backward to make 
sure their advisees (and their students for that matter) know the schedule 
or can easily find it. Advisors should encourage advisees to drop by for an 
informal chat. One method I use is to keep a single-serve coffee maker in 
the office that students are always free to use; if the advisor isn’t available in 
person, they should provide some means for student access. If nothing else, 
simply checking email once an hour during regular business hours is helpful. 
Social media accounts can also be employed, for example by having a page 
set aside where students can interact with their advisor. 
To take availability a step further, active mental availability should be 
considered in addition to physical availability. A former chemistry professor 
would literally sit in his office chair, facing the door, during office hours and 
do nothing else (maybe twiddle his thumbs) but wait for students to stop by. 
His students knew that he was there to actively listen, understand, and to 
provide feedback based on their needs because the sole purpose of his office 
Personalized Advising  |  265
hours was not to catch up on work, watch videos on YouTube, or read a book 
for leisure, but to provide them help. The intention of this example is not 
to suggest that such extreme measures are necessary for everyone, but if a 
student is to be helped, their needs must be understood. If advisors are to 
understand the needs of their students, they must actively listen—listen in 
such a way that the student isn’t just heard, but that they also feel heard, 
seen, and understood (Ranglund et al., 2017). 
When a student visits an advisor in their office, that student should have 
the advisor’s undivided attention until they can confidently leave with a 
solution or a plan for whatever the concern might have been. 
Adaptability 
Generally speaking, most approaches to teaching and advising can be 
categorized as “teacher-centered,” “student-centered,” or some combination 
of the two. This section will give some examples of advising strategies. As the 
shift is made to those descriptions, it is important to understand that all of 
these ideas (as well as others) should be in the “advising tool-belt” to be used 
or neglected as each occasion calls for it. However, the most important tool 
in the belt should be an adaptor that allows for the ability to adjust to the 
individual needs of the students. 
A purist approach, in most any field, is likely to end in disaster. This will 
be a recurring theme in the coming sections. As highly adored as student-
centered teaching (and advising) is, it is obvious that even these approaches 
require some aspect of teacher-centered guidance. If that were not so, 
teachers would be overpriced and obsolete relics of antiquity. Indeed, Dewey 
was somewhat critical of this approach in isolation (Dewey, 1938) as is a more 
recent article arguing that allowing students the absolute freedom to learn 
in an unguided environment is antithetical to the psychological principles 
encompassing working memory (Kirschener et al., 2006). This brings to 
memory an inspirational quotation: “The best teachers are those who show 
you where to look, but don’t tell you what to see.” This quotation beautifully 
encompasses both sides of the teacher-/student-centered paradigm by 
serving as a reminder that teachers and advisors should be guides—coaches 
on the sidelines, but that as coaches, must be flexible enough to know not 
only where to look, but how to inspire students to look until they’ve found 
266  |  Personalized Advising
the answer. If every student is unique in terms of experience, personality, 
and level of academic achievement (most are), this implies that an advisor 
must be limitlessly and existentially adaptable in order to inspire and 
motivate each individual student to press on towards the goal. 
What Advisors Can Learn From Other 
Disciplines 
Ascertaining and Admitting a Circle of Competence 
The ability of a person to know what they don’t know is arguably as 
important, if not more so, than what they do know. Being able to honestly 
divulge personal strengths and limitations falls under the category of 
personal competency and integrity. To some extent, this defines who a 
person is (Ranglund et al., 2017). Students are incredibly perceptive. With 
respect to advising, a former department chair at Averett University gave a 
piece of simple yet wise advice. He said, “If you don’t know something, don’t 
act like you do; they can see right through that. Tell them that you will find 
the answer and get back to them.” This advice nicely parallels the concept 
of “circle of competence,” which was originally intended as a principle of 
investing developed by Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger (Chairman/CEO 
and Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, respectively). The crux of the 
model is that everyone has the ability to make intelligent decisions in some 
area(s), but no one is an expert on everything (Parrish, 2013), and only people 
who are arrogant, foolish, or purposely deceptive pretend to be. As Charlie 
Munger put it, “A money manager with an IQ of 160 and thinks it’s 180 will 
kill you. Going with a money manager with an IQ of 130 who thinks it is 125 
could serve you well.” 
Munger’s words could be adapted to derive an equally wise advising 
principle by replacing “money manager” with “academic advisor.” This is true 
for several reasons, the most obvious being the plethora of elective courses 
(even at small liberal arts universities). Students have quite a bit of agency 
in exploring fringe interests as they pursue their primary goals (Thelin & 
Hirschy, 2009). This is great for students, and given the personal opportunity 
Personalized Advising  |  267
to impart change, more choices would be advocated for. However, so many 
options pose a challenge for advisors. At some point advisors will need to be 
guided as they guide their students. Advising does not afford the option to 
quarantine in a niche circle of competence; advisors don’t have the luxury 
of picking pitches; in fact, doing so would be antithetical to adaptability. 
However, they do have the responsibility to be open with their pupils about 
what they do and do not know. This is of paramount importance because 
transparent humility will foster trust in the advisor/advisee relationship. 
It is essential to develop a pattern of giving advice that advisees find to 
be trustworthy as this will foster the expectation that the given advice is 
always from an informed position. Because advisors do have a circle of 
competence, it is critical that advisees trust their advisors enough to know 
that professional remarks with respect to advice, feedback, criticism, 
commendations, etc., are credible and trustworthy. 
More Than an Advisor: A Coach 
To build on the coaching analogy, we will use pieces of a previously published 
coaching model for advising (McClellan & Moser, 2011). Thus far the 
importance of being available (physically and mentally), adaptable, and 
transparent about a circle of competence has been discussed. Together, 
application of these ideas builds rapport and assists the student to begin to 
both identify their own path to success and to devise a plan to achieve it. 
A good coach doesn’t stop there, but intently watches so as to be able to 
evaluate the success (or lack thereof) of the plan. The coach offers feedback 
regarding the mishaps and helps to identify steps that aid the future 
direction towards success. 
Evaluation of the success of the plan requires the advisor to pose questions 
that allow the students to reflect on their efforts (McClellan & Moser, 2011). 
Such questions help the advisor become more aware of the student’s thought 
process; the answers might identify details of the situation of which the 
advisor might not have been previously aware, and should be considered 
as future directions are proposed (McClellan & Moser, 2011). Questions also 
serve as a means of assessment of the student’s problem-solving ability 
(McClellan & Moser, 2011) thus directing the advisor to move toward a more 
“hands-on” or “hands-off” advising approach (Intrusive/Proactive Advising). 
268  |  Personalized Advising
Considering future directions from which to attack a problem involves 
brainstorming. The advisor should be prepared to ask questions that 
encourage the activity. Though there are a number of questions that could 
be useful, one of particular personal appeal is, “If our positions were 
reversed, and you were offering me advice, what would you tell me?” Follow-
up questions may similarly draw from what the student anticipates another 
involved party might recommend (McClellan & Moser, 2011). It is perfectly 
acceptable for the advisor to offer ideas as well, however, it is best to do so 
after the student has had an opportunity to think, so as to avoid intrusive 
advising. This is also to be done with humility: An advisor should not 
arrogantly insist or imply that their ideas are better than any others, but 
rather offer them as additional ideas that might be of value (McClellan & 
Moser, 2011). 
Once several viable ideas have been presented, the coaching model of 
advising suggests that the advisor help the student evaluate and choose an 
approach to be molded into a plan with which to address the problems 
(McClellan & Moser, 2011). Finally, advising as a coach requires seeing the 
plan through. The student must be encouraged to stick to the plan and to 
give an account of their progress (McClellan & Moser, 2011). 
More Than an Advisor: A Counselor 
This chapter has alluded to the fact that advising entails much more than 
the academic milieu. With the personal development of students being 
dependent on advising to some extent, part of the time used to prepare 
for advising sessions should be spent considering that an advisor may be 
called upon to assist students with interpersonal relationships, personal 
challenges, work/life balance, co-curricular activities, and so on (Kuhn et 
al., 2006). Having served as an advisor for only a few years, I will attest 
to what more experienced advisors have noted for decades: Students often 
have complicated personal issues that, if left on their own, will be barriers 
to success (Kuhn et al., 2006). Any barrier to the success of the students 
is a barrier to the success of an advisor. Thus, the academic component 
of advising must happen in the context of advisees’ personal needs, values, 
goals, and circumstances (Kuhn et al., 2006). 
Personalized Advising  |  269
Discernment can be aided by active listening skills, however, such 
challenges call for advisors to demonstrate empathy. That is, compassion 
must be shown in times of stress, the cause of which can vary greatly in its 
range of severity. Placing a high value on education tends to be accompanied 
by an innate concern about students, and as previously noted, active 
listening is an exemplary fruit of empathy. Actively listening to students’ 
concerns (big or small) lends emotional support (Hybels & Weaver, n.d.). 
Emotional support as it pertains to extracurricular affairs can move 
perilously close to the line of most academic advisors’ competency circles. 
While crossing the boundaries of certain competencies may not be 
particularly harmful, crossing this boundary can be. Most advisors are not 
mental health counselors. However, psychology literature suggests that 
empathy is associated with positive prognoses in therapeutic environments 
(Laska et al., 2014). Therefore, it stands to reason that empathetic listening, 
as the best source of outside help is deductively determined, can be helpful. 
The focus of this section is clearly not as enjoyable as the rest of the 
chapter. However, the responsibility to help early career faculty brace 
themselves for an occasional encounter with a student who has a need 
in which they are unable and/or unqualified to intervene must be 
acknowledged. Indeed, there are scenarios that may very well surface in an 
advising meeting that should be referred to other campus resource offices 
including student success and/or counseling. The reader is encouraged to 
introduce themself to the folks who work in these offices so that they are 
prepared to turn to them when situations arise that call for their expertise. 
Seeking help from another office (or another faculty member) is the advisor’s 
responsibility. By seeking help, the discipline required of the advisor to admit 
her/his circle of competence is demonstrated as part of the fulfillment 
of duty to ensure that the students’ personal and academic success is as 
attainable as it possibly can be. Kuhn et al. (2006) presents an excellent list 
of issues with which an advisor might be confronted along with an indicator 
that generally indicates whether the issue is addressable by most academic 
advisors (Figure 12.1). 
270  |  Personalized Advising
Figure 12.1 Categorization of responsibility in potential advising issues. 
General Approaches to Advising 
The purpose of this section is to describe some practical approaches to 
advising. To preface, it has been argued since the 1960s, by those conducting 
psychotherapy research, that the nature of the professional relationship, 
as opposed to any specific approach or technique, is most contributive to 
client satisfaction (Beutler et al., 1994; Rogers, 1992; Truax & Carkhuff, 1967). 
Thus, any of the following approaches to advising might be beneficial at 
some point. However, it suggested that these ideas be kept as tools in a 
toolkit to be deployed when the situation calls for it, and further, that these 
ideas be considered to exist on a sliding scale—that is, there are varying 
degrees of implementation. The approach taken and the degree to which 
it is taken will differ depending on the individual needs of the student. 
For instance, students may prefer aspects of either a developmental or 
prescriptive approach to advising so far as certain relational elements are 
demonstrated by the advisor (Mottarella et al., 2004). 
Developmental Advising 
Many advisees in science departments approach their advisors with an 
interest in pursuing careers in medicine. Thus, from this perspective, it 
would be remiss if the concept of osteopathic medicine weren’t mentioned 
Personalized Advising  |  271
somewhere in this chapter. A short justification clause for developmental 
advising seems to be the perfect place. Many people are not aware that there 
are two doctoral degrees in the United States that allow for full licensure 
to practice as a physician in any area of medicine. A Doctor of Osteopathic 
Medicine (DO) is trained to practice medicine from the perspective that 
the human body is a three-part being—an integrated whole comprised of 
mind, body, and spirit. It is often noted that a broken spirit can be every 
bit as painful as a broken bone. Further, a DO recognizes the paramount 
importance of the reciprocal relationship between structure and function 
and that wellbeing is often affected by factors outside of what is purely 
physical. This holistic approach to medicine is somewhat analogous to a 
holistic approach to advising that is developmental in nature. Developmental 
advising recognizes that the academic pursuits of the student can’t be 
completely understood without seeing the whole student. 
Together, developmental and prescriptive advising have historically 
dominated the field of advising (Barbuto et al., 2011; Crookston, 1972). 
Developmental advising is a controversial topic as the literature defines it 
in several different ways. Further, it has been criticized as aiming toward 
goals that are outside the realm of the traditionally held outcomes of higher 
education (Bloland et al., 1994; Hemwall & Trachte, 1999). Indeed, 
developmental advising is typically depicted as a model of counseling to the 
end of personal growth (Hemwall & Trachte, 2005). Though some academics 
are critical of such an approach, as this chapter has noted, this author 
believes that academic advising is far more than an occupation that 
promotes mere intellectual growth, but that intellectual growth is only 
achievable so long as personal growth is the cornerstone that supports 
the intellectual pursuit. Developmental advising supports this rationale as it 
allows advisors to embrace advising as a practice that recognizes students as 
multidimensional and should be supported emotionally, physically, morally, 
economically, and vocationally as well as intellectually (Boyle et al., 2012). 
Thus, despite criticism of the approach, developmental advising has been 
shown to be the ideal advising approach for university students (Gordon, 
1994; Winston & Sandor, 1984). 
To advise a student with such a goal, the student-advisor relationship 
should allow the advisor to pose questions whose answers will reveal the 
students’ goals. To approach advising with a developmental focus, awareness 
of the students’ current state is necessary (Grites, 2013). As mentioned 
earlier, it is helpful to note these goals on the inside of advising files so 
272  |  Personalized Advising
that time can be taken to discuss progress during each meeting. These 
goals include those directly related to education, but also include career 
and personal goals (Winston et al., 1982). These broader goals might require 
a student to acquire a skill or seek professional experience outside of the 
institution. 
Once those goals have been noted, advisors should help their students 
put together a plan of action that aims to accomplish these goals while 
promoting both intellectual and personal development. Keep in mind that 
the students may need the advisor to help find and use institutional, 
community, and perhaps personal resources to realize those goals (Winston 
& Sandor, 1984). It should also be understood by both parties that this is a 
shared commitment (Grites, 2013). The student must be honest and direct; 
the advisor must be tolerant and able to inspire; both student and advisor 
must be trustworthy, adaptable, and dependable (Grites, 2013). 
The argument that developmental advising involves extracurricular 
factors, and falls outside the scope of most job descriptions is well taken. 
However, most educators have an intrinsic understanding of human dignity 
and the fact that their brothers and sisters of humanity are far from cookie-
cutter and are incredibly complex. It is thus natural that a developmental 
approach would be at the core of every other practical or theoretical 
approach to academic advising. 
Prescriptive Advising 
Prescriptive advising is somewhat of a contrasting approach to 
developmental advising. While the latter recognizes the art of advising as 
a broad discipline that requires some degree of care for aspects of student 
life that go beyond academics, prescriptive advising mostly limits advising 
to matters that are directly related to academics. The advisor-advisee 
relationship in prescriptive advising has been compared to the physician-
patient relationship in that the patient/student is given information 
necessary for progression of health/intellect (Barbuto et al., 2011). Such an 
approach uses advising sessions explicitly for course selection, registration, 
degree requirements, discussions of curriculum, and so on (Drake, 2011). 
Personalized Advising  |  273
It has been noted that prescriptive advising is only a theoretical concept 
(Crookston, 1972). When considering the physician-patient relationship, it 
is nearly impossible to imagine the field of medicine without compassion, 
which by definition comes from some degree of personal concern. 
Regardless of whether it is ever practiced in the purest sense, the philosophy 
of prescriptive advising is incredibly important as the academic pursuits of 
students are at the heart of the student-advisor relationship. Service as an 
advisor requires accurate knowledge of the degree requirements (Crosbie, 
2005) or at the very least, where to find them. While it is not typically 
in the nature of a teacher’s heart to default to prescriptive advising, there 
are students who frankly want, and in some sense demand, prescriptive 
advising. Indeed, a recent study showed that 17 out of 429 surveyed students 
preferred prescriptive advising (Hale et al., 2009). While prescriptive advising 
is obviously not the most commonly preferred approach, it should always 
be kept in mind that different students find value in different advising 
techniques, and advisors should be ready to employ the technique that is 
most conducive to each student’s success. 
Burn Crookston’s work (1972) provides an accurate depiction of 
prescriptive advising. Personal experience has shown that students who 
prefer this approach view their academic advisors as a source of information 
about the university. They want a cut-and-dried answer or plan to answer 
a question about an academic topic. A prescriptive advisor would 
hypothetically answer the specific questions, but would not address more 
comprehensive concerns (Crookston, 1972). To reiterate, such an approach is 
not the personal default, and the literature supports the rationale that pure 
prescriptive advising is not a viable option in the modern era (White, 2020). 
Even students who seem to seek a prescriptive advising session should 
be challenged to at least be inwardly inquisitive about their own questions, 
and should be pressed to consider their rationale for certain questions. For 
example, if a student were to inquire about the process of adding a minor, 
changing a major, or enrolling in an elective that is outside of their field, the 
inquiry could be justifiably met with a question that is on the cutting-edge of 
advising: “Why?” While there is often solid reasoning for students to ask such 
questions, occasionally, a student has simply made a rash and/or illogical 
decision, and they need to be protected from themself. 
In this respect, while prescriptive advising might be the elemental 
approach for some students, it might be more appropriate to view such an 
advisor-advisee relationship as that between a client and a financial advisor. 
274  |  Personalized Advising
Dave Ramsey, who is a radio personality specializing in personal finance, 
often says with respect to investing that “the only way to get hurt on a roller 
coaster is to jump off.” All three of the professions mentioned in this section 
(physician, financial advisor, academic advisor) call for a compassionate 
professional with genuine care for the success and well-being of those who 
are dependent on their advice. It would be next to impossible to ask a 
compassionate person to be so emotionally withdrawn as to allow someone 
under their care to jump off the metaphorical roller coaster without at least 
trying to prevent such a catastrophe. Thus, despite being mostly theoretical, 
this section addresses prescriptive advising as it entails some fundamental 
concepts at least and handful students will likely be encountered during the 
career of an advisor who need or prefer prescriptive direction. However, 
both the literature and personal experience suggest that it would be unwise 
(perhaps careless) to become a prescriptive purest. 
Intrusive/Proactive Advising 
Regardless of whether an approach is developmental, instructive, or a 
combination of the two, students might also be well-served by varying 
degrees of intrusiveness. Touted as a means of reaching at-risk students 
(Heisserer & Parette, 2002), intrusive advising involves proactively 
anticipating problems before they arise (Varney, 2007). 
Natural inclination would be to divide this section into two by labeling one 
“hands-on advising” and the other “hands-off advising.” However, there is 
little to no literature discussing the effects of a purely “hands-off” approach 
to academic advising. And, to be clear, it is also well noted that intrusive/
proactive advising should not be construed as “hand-holding” (Upcraft & 
Kramer, 1995). In fact, it is based on the idea that the advisor and student 
have shared responsibility for success. Thus, my personal contention is that 
most students require some balance of “hands-on” and “hands-off” advising; 
or as will be considered here, some degree of intrusiveness. 
Truly “hands-on” advising would in essence be “hand-holding” as it would 
point out every possible roadblock, offer a set of instructions describing how 
to avoid/get around the roadblocks, and not allow a student to make a move 
that is likely to result in failure of any sort. Such an approach would likely 
be disadvantageous because it devalues the learning process by withholding 
Personalized Advising  |  275
valuable teachable moments that strengthen character and discipline. In 
fact, being too intrusive can negatively affect a student’s attitude toward 
advising, causing them to eschew help (Herget, 2017). The opposite extreme 
of this sort of advising would allow a student to encounter every problem 
on their own without any warning and then perhaps work with the student 
to solve the issues once they arise. This “hands-off” approach would also 
be problematic because there are some situations that are not so easily 
remedied. 
Intrusive advising nicely balances these two ideas. That is, advisors should 
aim to be inviting, friendly, and warm while still implementing the touch 
of tough love that students need for optimal growth (Cannon, 2013). For 
example, as obvious as it might seem to you, many new college students 
aren’t inclined to contact their advisors. Being aware of this common pitfall 
allows the advisor to avoid it by proactively making the initial contact with 
the students. This can be as simple as providing a personal introduction, 
briefly noting what is expected from the advisees and what the advisees 
should expect from their advisor (Cannon, 2013). The students might also be 
encouraged to reply with their own introduction (Cannon, 2013). It is also 
appropriate to ask the students if there is anything that the advisor should 
know about them and whether there is anything that they would like to know 
about the advisor. 
To give an example of the balance between “hands-on” and “hands-off” 
advising that intrusive advising offers, consider advising a student with 
respect to course load. First, regardless of the ratio of “hands-on” to “hands-
off” used, the importance of being prepared for advising appointments has 
already been noted. To reiterate, it is wise to use the prior afternoon to 
review any notes about the student and their grades, extracurricular 
activities, and personal situations. With that, the advisor should be prepared 
to pose questions that allow for some degree of intrusiveness. It is well-
known that there is a bit of finesse to class scheduling, and varying degrees 
of intrusiveness can be used to help students avoid potential pitfalls. 
Generally, a full-time course load can range from 12-18 credit hours. 
Information gathered from these intrusive questions can be used to offer 
students advice based on experience. For example, a student who holds a 
full-time job outside of school and has historically struggled academically 
might benefit more from a course load of about 12 hours whereas someone 
who has a history of academic excellence and has no job outside of school 
276  |  Personalized Advising
might be able to handle a heavier course load. Perhaps it is also typical for 
students who take course X along with course Y to perform better or worse 
compared to those who take them separately. 
A “hands-off” approach to advising would tell the students where to find 
the degree requirements, perhaps show them a sample 4-year schedule 
leading to degree completion, and have them select and enroll in classes 
on their own. The only intervention that a “hands-off” advisor might make 
would be to keep a student from taking a course for which they have not met 
a prerequisite. On the other hand, an exclusively intrusive advisor might go 
so far as to not approve a schedule that they believe to be less than optimal. 
A perfect balance of intrusive advising as it is intended would provide 
students with all the information and warnings of historical areas of struggle, 
but still allow them to make their own decisions. With this approach, both 
the advisor and the student share the responsibility for success. 
Concluding Remarks 
I hope that you are now keenly aware that academic advising is a 
multifaceted art. Unfortunately, there is no one right way to advise students. 
There is no one right way to advise any “category” of students because every 
student has a unique set of life experiences, needs, priorities, and goals. 
If you are ever (un)fortunate enough to advise students at more than one 
institution, you’ll also find that advising differs quite drastically depending on 
the structure of the institution (e.g., community college, liberal arts schools, 
technological institutes). 
Regardless of where you are in preparation for your first/next advising 
appointment, my advice to you is to be prepared to show your students how 
much you care. Take some time to get to know your advisees. Students have 
argued that interest in students’ personalities, recognition of their merits, 
and trust in them tend to contribute to the improvement of the advisor-
advisee relationship, which translates to increased student satisfaction and 
subsequently to improvement in academic performance (Fielstein, 1989). 
Regardless of how well you know your advisees, observe them as 
multidimensional human beings (they are). Approaching advising with this 
Personalized Advising  |  277
mindset will push you to be adaptable regarding the needs of your students. 
Perhaps most importantly, remember to be available to your students both 
physically and mentally. 
I suggest that you spend some time in mental preparation for the fact 
that you will inevitably be called upon to coach students through 
problems—some of which are emotionally taxing to say the least. Regardless 
of the circumstances that arise in your world of advising, I hope that this 
work has encouraged you to reflect on your advising persona. Further, I hope 
that it has given you some ideas/tools that might be useful as you begin to 
master the exhilarating art of advising. 
Finally, I implore you to not be afraid of advising. With confidence and a 
spirit of humility, embrace it, enjoy it, and rest assured that you are very 
much up to the task. 
Reflection Questions 
•
What personal changes could you make to improve advising
quality?
•
Does the physical and emotional environment in which you
advise inspire trust in the advisor/advisee relationship? What
steps can you take to improve this?
•
Without considering any particular student, what advising
approach(es) are you most likely to implement?
•
Despite your tendency to gravitate towards certain
approaches to advising, what steps might you take to embrace
methods that are outside your comfort zone?

13. Engaging the Fear: How to
Utilize Student Evaluations,
Accept Feedback, and Further
Teaching Practice
COURTNEY VENGRIN 
Introduction 
While nearly every campus and class conduct evaluations of teaching in 
some capacity, the effect and use of these evaluations vary widely. The 
majority of these evaluations are done at the end of the semester, and if 
any changes are made, these only impact future students. This feedback 
is also difficult for faculty to digest. It can be scary and uncomfortable to 
“look under the hood” and see what is working and what is going wrong. 
Furthermore, these evaluations are often discussed in high-stakes contexts, 
such as annual reviews. In this chapter, we dissect the evaluation of the 
teaching process and ask critical questions: Are these evaluations helping us 
become better educators? How are these data used? Is this process equitable 
for students and instructors? How should evaluations be framed? Should 
students be trained? What about the mid-semester evaluation process? Are 
there other options? What improvements can we make?

Teaching evaluations are useful but have to be structured, reviewed, and 
administered in the appropriate context to garner maximum value both for 
the time of the educator and of the student. The research will be discussed 
on both end-of-the-semester and mid semester evaluation processes. A 
variety of instruments and approaches will be presented, and an outline for 
training students will be included. 
This chapter will discuss…

The history of student evaluations of teaching

The collection process for student evaluation data

How to create a plan for utilizing your student evaluation
data
History of Student Evaluation of Teaching (SETs) 
The methods by which we determine what “good teaching” looks like have 
been the topic of much debate for almost as long as the field of education 
has existed. As such, there are a multitude of techniques for evaluating 
the effectiveness of one’s teaching, ranging from peer evaluations and 
committee reviews to the Student Evaluation of Teaching (SET). Teaching 
evaluations take many forms throughout K-12 and higher education 
classrooms and are often used to determine improvements to be made and 
even in discussing promotion and advancement (Dodeen, 2013). One of the 
most common metrics by which teaching is judged is the SET. 
Much of the current literature discusses appropriate use of the SET, but 
there is not one clear, uniform means by which to assess and utilize student 
evaluations of teaching (Braga et al., 2014; Dodeen, 2013). Traditional 
Engaging the Fear  |  285
evaluations of teaching are often done at the end of the semester, collected, 
and left unread until an official review by administration or other outside 
impetus forces us to confront how our students felt. It’s all too easy to 
put reading and reflecting on these evaluations off as we typically get the 
information near holiday or summer break. We have other things to do, 
family to see, grants to write. Additionally, we question the usefulness of 
these evaluations, wondering, for example, whether it is just a popularity 
contest. Students also question how these evaluations are used, if at all 
(Brown, 2008). 
In addition to the traditional end of semester SET, mid semester 
evaluations are a burgeoning topic in higher education. Through using a 
mid semester evaluation faculty are able to make adjustments to teaching 
practice to better address current student needs and thereby provide a 
better educational experience (Blash et al., 2018). Quality teaching means 
constant improvement. This improvement should not just come at the end of 
the semester but can and should be a continual process of reflection. 
Finally, we would be remiss to not acknowledge the place of equity in the 
subjective nature of student evaluations of teaching. Research has shown 
that SETs tend to favor the white male instructor archetype (Boring, 2017; 
Dodeen, 2013). One study in particular used an online class where students 
did not have face to face time with the instructor but were given an 
instructor name that sounded either traditionally female or male (MacNell 
et al., 2015). The course content was identical but the (presumably) male 
instructor received higher ratings. Female-presenting instructors are also 
more likely to get comments on their appearance than male presenting 
instructors. 
Any subjective measure is open to implicit bias. Causes of bias also vary 
widely, from implicit bias to bias stemming from an expected grade (Boring, 
2017; Nasser-Abu Alhija, 2017). We must recognize that these measures are 
imperfect and utilize the data accordingly. The appropriate use of SET data 
is discussed further later in this chapter, taking into account these factors of 
bias. We will also review some potential methods of mitigating bias in SETs. 
286  |  Engaging the Fear
Collecting SETs 
Almost every institution uses some form of teaching evaluation. These 
processes are often driven by a top-down approach, resulting in less-than-
ideal feedback for the instructor. As a new instructor, a good practice is 
to look into the form or forms available, understand the process, and see 
what options exist. Are you able to add additional questions? Are there 
department-specific questions? What is the review process like for these 
forms? Can you conduct your own “off cycle” evaluation? Become involved in 
the process so that you can advocate for evaluations that will benefit your 
teaching and your students. 
Understanding the form, knowing what questions are on it, knowing the 
timing of when it will be available to students, when you as an instructor 
receive the results, and who receives the results are all important. In some 
cases, departments or colleges may limit the number of evaluations or who 
is evaluated. For example, if you are a veterinary faculty member specializing 
in dentistry, you may only guest lecture two hours all semester with the 
rest of your teaching done in a clinical setting. In some cases, due to the 
survey burden, there may be rules in place that say instructors with fewer 
than five hours of teaching time are not evaluated. Or perhaps you are a 
graduate student doing some guest lecturing; you only have one hour of 
teaching time, but you need evaluations of your teaching to add to your 
job packet for future employment. Seek out assistance from departments to 
see if exceptions can be made. Additionally, with “off cycle” evaluations, it is 
important to know the timing. If you guest lecture in the third week of the 
course but the evaluations do not become available to students until week 
12, they are likely to not remember you well, and are therefore more likely to 
give inaccurate information. 
While nearly every campus and class conduct evaluations of teaching in 
some capacity, the effect and use of these evaluations varies widely. Most 
of these evaluations are done at the end of the semester and if any changes 
are made in the teaching, these only impact future students. Mid-semester 
evaluations offer an alternative. By “taking the temperature” of a class at the 
midpoint of the semester, faculty are able to check in and see what students 
are enjoying and what changes may need to be made. Students also respond 
positively to the use of mid-semester evaluations given that they can directly 
benefit from the results and are therefore more inclined to respond to the 
Engaging the Fear  |  287
evaluation whereas at the end of the semester they are more apt to skip 
the survey, get their grade, and head on to the next course (Brown, 2008; 
Frick et al., 2009). Providing assessment and feedback opportunities during a 
course rather than at the end, students are given the power to advocate for 
their own educational experiences and faculty are more empowered to make 
changes to better the educational environment for all involved. 
Engaging with SET Data 
Once we have collected some form of SET data, either through our own 
means or that of external forces, the next step is to engage with our data. 
Half the time it will sit there for a long while, ignored as we go into the 
summer holiday or summer research venue. But eventually you have to look 
at it. 
Engaging with our feedback data as part of reflexive teaching practice is 
one of the most beneficial things we can do, but it is often one of the most 
difficult. Looking at our evaluations and feedback often brings up feelings of 
judgement, apprehension, and inadequacy. To push past this discomfort, it is 
important to remember that the data are not there to sit in judgement of you. 
It’s there to help you. It’s there for you to respond to as well. No, not directly 
to those students, but to the next class, in most cases. Your response comes 
in the changes you make, the ways you continue to improve over the course 
of your career. Sometimes the feedback is painful. Sometimes it’s funny. 
Sometimes it could be more constructive, but it’s feedback, nonetheless. It’s 
an assessment. And those data need to be used. Not just by administration 
and end of semester reports, but by you. How will you respond? How will you 
use YOUR data? 
Sometimes, ripping off the Band-Aid is the best approach. Just sit down 
with a strong cup of coffee and skim through it. You may be surprised. Often, 
you will find at least one compliment or positive note to move forward with. 
Sometimes it’s even just a simple “Thank you” that helps us feel appreciated. 
Find those and hold on to them. 
288  |  Engaging the Fear
We know that if given no incentive, typically the most satisfied and most 
dissatisfied individuals respond to evaluations. They love you or they hate 
you. So don’t go in expecting all sunshine and daisies. Expect to get feedback 
that is less than pleasant and know that you have room to improve. We all do. 
When scoring SETs, especially at the departmental or program level, 
ranking is not advised (Sachs & Parsell, 2014; Schmelkin et al., 1997). This 
includes ranking within a course for which you are instructor in charge. The 
scores are typically on a Likert scale and when these scores are reported 
to faculty, typically they have been mean scored, which in some 
recommendations is inappropriate for Likert-scaled items. To further 
extrapolate this score into a ranking is not appropriate. Furthermore, 
ranking employees, faculty, or staff in general lowers morale and is 
inadvisable (Sachs & Parsell, 2014). Additionally, it is important to recall the 
bias present in SETs when reviewing these as a department or program 
review. Given these issues with SETs, the data gathered from these 
subjective measures are most useful as formative feedback for the instructor 
and course, and not for making personnel- or department-related decisions. 
However, scores, even those that are mean scored, can be useful if we 
first work to understand the score in context. What was going on during 
this time? What occurred this semester? Were there any abnormalities or 
issues that arose? Were there any large-scale world or campus events that 
may have impacted students? What bias may be present within the data? 
Additionally, how was the SET distributed? Was it available for a long period 
of time, or a short time period? Was it discussed in class or only sent out 
via link? Research indicates that all of these variables can impact the score. 
In one article, the weather significantly impacted the teaching effectiveness 
scores (Braga et al., 2014). 
Moving past the somewhat arbitrary score, the bulk of the SET tends to be 
in the nebulous comments section. The comments can be the most daunting 
and analytically confusing section for individuals to engage with, given that 
students’ responses vary widely from constructive feedback to inappropriate 
comments on appearance. So how do you examine the comments? 
There are two methods for examining the comments: in-depth analysis, 
and a surface-level view. The end use of the insight gained should be 
considered when determining which approach to take. Did you try 
something new with students and want to see how it went? Was there a 
specific question about a portion of your teaching that you added to the 
Engaging the Fear  |  289
evaluation form? What level of data would be most useful for your purposes? 
Answering these questions will help determine how to go about breaking 
down the comment section. 
Surface analysis 
In order to do a surface analysis, all you will need to do is a quick read-
through of each comment. See where the majority of student opinion is 
falling. Get a blank piece of paper (or spreadsheet) and divide it in three 
columns labeled “theme,” “positive,” and “negative.” Do a quick scan of the 
comments. Read each one and write the general theme down in the first 
column, and then place a check or tally mark for either positive or negative. 
Each time you come across the same theme, add a new mark in that theme’s 
section. Create new themes as you go through the comments. Using this 
method, it should not take very long to paint a concise picture of what is 
going well and what changes you may want to make. See table 13.1 for an 
example. 
Table 13.1 Example of comment analysis.

290  |  Engaging the Fear
In-depth analysis 
In some cases, an in-depth analysis will be more useful. You may be just 
starting out in your teaching career and want to better understand how 
things are going, or maybe you tried a new technique like flipped classroom 
and want to use the feedback to decide if changes are needed. Similar to 
the surface analysis, you can create an Excel spreadsheet of your comments. 
Often, you can get the comments already loaded into Excel from your 
evaluation software or the entity that does the evaluation data collection. 
Mirroring the technique of the surface analysis, you will create additional 
columns beside the comment column—however instead of positive and 
negative, you will create two to three theme categories. Often, there are 
lengthy comments that address several elements, so use a column for each 
theme. As you read through your comments, note the themes. Once you 
have completed this, use Excel’s “sort” function and sort the themes 
alphabetically. You can then create summaries of all the comments in that 
theme and determine what is working well and what you may need to 
change. Make additional notes on which areas you want to focus on moving 
forward. It is sometimes useful to do an additional calculation of the 
percentages of the themes, thereby quantifying the data for further review. 
In doing this you may find that 40% of students commented that the pace of 
the course was too slow, while 10% found it too fast. See what changes can 
be made and save this file for comparison against your next SET. This can be 
useful in your annual review as metrics of your efforts and changes made to 
better your teaching practice. 
However, when engaging with this process, remember to take all the 
feedback with a grain of salt. Not just the bad parts, but the good, too. 
You may be perfect in one student’s eyes, the one who got an A, loves the 
discipline, knew you from another class, and thinks you walk on water. But 
are you really all that that student makes you out to be? No. And are you 
really a horrible, terrible, mean, imbecile like the other student said? Also 
no. Where are you? Probably in between. So be humble and self-reflective. 
Know that you aren’t perfect but know that by reading and analyzing your 
feedback, you can make your teaching practice better. Remember that it’s 
your data. The assessment of your efforts (but not of you as a person, 
remember that). So, use it to your advantage. 
Engaging the Fear  |  291
Using SET Data 
There are several ways you can use your SET data once you’ve gone over 
it. One potential option is to add it to your teaching portfolio, as a way to 
add detail to your teaching effectiveness. You can use your SET data in the 
form of summarized student evaluations of teaching, including response rate 
and relationship to departmental average. You may also want to include a 
select number of written comments from students on class evaluations. To 
supplement these, you can also include comments from a peer observer or a 
colleague teaching the same course. 
Another use of your SET data is for course improvement. This will take 
some additional searching and analysis to determine what data you have 
access to. Many institutions use two forms of evaluations, a teaching 
evaluation and a course evaluation. If you are the lead instructor for the 
course, you most likely will receive both. However, if you are a secondary 
instructor within the course, you may not receive the course evaluation. It 
would be a good idea to reach out to the lead instructor to ask if you might 
see the course-level data. Sometimes this data will need to be amended to 
remove comments about other faculty members. Once you have access to 
these data you can analyze them for the comments regarding your teaching 
as well as the comments regarding the course structure. What changes can 
you make? What are reasonable suggestions? What worked well? These data 
also serve as a great opportunity to demonstrate to future students that you 
are listening! You may wish to take a few comments and add them to your 
syllabus or go over them on the first day of class and let students know about 
the changes you have made based on last year’s class comments. Remember, 
this is YOUR data to help you improve your teaching as well as your course. 
Use it! Don’t just let it go to waste! 
A final use for this evaluation data is as a component of an overarching 
programmatic improvement. This will often be at the department or college 
level. The process for this involves reviewing the data as a whole. As stated 
earlier, this department-level review process should not rely solely on data 
from SETs, but should provide a full picture of the program, including 
interviews, observations, and document analysis. Once the data are 
collected, areas for improvement can be pinpointed, much the same as 
with a smaller, classroom-level evaluation. Once these areas are identified, 
leadership should meet with teaching teams as well as individuals to discuss 
292  |  Engaging the Fear
the findings and agree upon a forward direction. If done correctly, this 
should be a positive experience. Evaluations and evaluation data should not 
be used to punish or shame departments, programs, or individuals. 
Conclusion 
In summary, remember that your SET data are just that, yours! You can use 
it to help you improve your teaching, your course, and your department. 
As with all subjective measures, not all of your evaluators will agree. Find 
the evaluation comments and sections that you feel are the most true and 
applicable for your teaching. Harness your data and make improvements 
where you can. Never stop growing as an educator! 
Reflection Questions 
•
How can you make better use of your SET data?
•
If you could ask your former students for feedback on any
one thing related to your teaching, what would it be?
•
What parts of your current SET process are working well for
you? Which parts could be improved?

VIGNETTE: So You've Landed 
the Job... (or Surviving Your First 
Semester) 
LAURA HANZLY 
During my last semester at Virginia Tech, I was instructor for a course I had 
helped teach as either co-instructor or Teaching Assistant for the past two 
years. Three months later I would be at a brand-new university and the 
instructor for two courses that were completely new to me. My time at VT 
had lulled me into a false sense of confidence and security in my teaching; 
I knew my lessons plans front and back and by the time I was instructor of 
record I also knew what wouldn’t work in the classroom. This was in stark 
contrast to my first semester as a newly hired lecturer fresh out of graduate 
school. I had almost no time to plan lessons before the semester began, was 
unfamiliar with the courses I was teaching, and most importantly had to find 
a way to deal with the realization I had no way of knowing what would and 
wouldn’t work for my courses. 
To help deal with these feelings of being overwhelmed and imposter 
syndrome that may come with your first semester of teaching, I found mid-
semester course evaluations vitally important. I already knew the benefits 
of mid-semester evaluations in terms of students having a voice in the 
classroom and feedback for teaching style and course design, but I did not 
realize how hearing students’ feedback would instantly reduce my imposter 
syndrome feelings and eliminate my constant second guessing of the lesson 
plans I created.

Introduction 
CAROL LYNN MODER 
Overview of the Book 
This textbook is designed specifically to meet the academic writing needs of international students studying at 
universities in the United States.  The materials in the book can be covered within a 14-week semester, but each chapter 
or section may also be used independently. 
Based on a series of needs analysis projects, this textbook provides an overview of major rhetorical patterns of writing 
that are commonly used in university settings in the United States. 
These commonly required genres include descriptive and evaluative summaries, short essays, comparison and 
contrast assignments, literature reviews, descriptive reports, and proposals.  The textbook includes chapters that 
address the structure and purpose of these more common genres, including an awareness of the ways that the target 
audience and situation should shape the writing of each. 
A second important focus of the textbook is teaching students how to make effective use of sources within established 
academic integrity standards.  Many international students come from academic environments in which intellectual 
property is viewed as common to the community rather than belonging to an individual.  Their prior academic writing 
experience has generally not placed great emphasis on “giving credit” for ideas and words to a particular author.  The 
result is confusion about exactly how to avoid plagiarism.  In this textbook, we incorporate a treatment of these issues 
into the various chapters of the book.  Using an iterative approach, we give students repeated exposure to standards 
and practices.  This iteration improves the students’ ability to master these potentially unfamiliar practices. 
The third focus of the book is on key grammatical forms and constructions that are important in each of the types 
of writing the students will practice. Although many other textbooks include grammar exercises, these are typically 
presented in relation to isolated sentences, rather than integrated into the complex context of a particular assignment. 
International composition students are often able to perform well on sentence-based exercises because these exercises 
do not capture the complex content or structures that create errors in their academic writing. By treating grammar 
integratively in context, we hope to address more effectively the aspects that cause difficulties in academic writing. 
These sections are also presented cyclically, so that students will have multiple opportunities to practice and integrate 
key grammatical features. To do so, the authors of the book have employed a usage-based approach, examining in detail 
the grammatical structures used in both published and student writing in each of the genres of writing we discuss. All 
examples used in the book come from authentic examples of university or professional academic writing.

WRITING THROUGH NARRATIVE 
Why the Narrative Essay? 
If you’re like many college students, you have never written a narrative essay (and perhaps have never even heard of it), 
and that’s okay. This chapter is designed to help you understand why it’s included as one of your writing assignments, 
what separates it from other styles of writing, how to most effectively structure it, and what outcomes you should hope 
to achieve once you’ve written it. 
The narrative essay provides a unique opportunity for you to tell a personal story within the context of academic 
writing. Although empirical research and data are certainly vital in academia, personal experiences can provide 
intriguing perspectives in helping us better understand the world in which we live, and should therefore be valued as a 
useful form of academic writing as well.  An added benefit to the writer is it narrative essays tend to be more enjoyable 
to write than other types of essays because of the emphasis on personal storytelling: narrative writing encourages you 
to express yourself by sharing personal experiences in a way most other forms of academic writing do not. Because 
you’re telling a story, you should definitely consider how you incorporate the various components that make up a story. 
For instance, the beginning of a story is where you are introduced to the story’s setting and main characters; therefore 
your introduction should include this information. The middle of the story is where major developments, rising action, 
climax, and falling action take place, which corresponds directly to your body paragraph. Lastly, the end of the story 
contains the resolution, which in your narrative essay will be your thesis and any other last insights you want to leave 
with your audience. 
It is important to keep in mind, though, that you are not simply telling the story to entertain or amuse use; the purpose 
of a narrative essay is to communicate with specific message to your audience did the use of personal stories and 
examples. Thus, you must intentionally choose personal experiences from your past that enable you to communicate 
and meaningful message to your audience. Given a writing prompt, your audience will often be specified to help you 
better understand for whom you are writing and why. However, in cases where your audience is not specified, you 
should consider your audience to be someone who is interested in how your personal experiences provide insight into 
the particular topic you’re writing about. 
Considering your audience is crucial because your audience determines the particular style with which you 
communicate your message. If you are skeptical regarding this truth or simply feel ill-equipped to properly address your 
audience, consider the following examples. Do you speak to your grandparents differently than the way you speak to 
your best friend? Does an email you sent to a classmate sound different than the one you sent your professor? If the 
answers to these questions seem like an obvious “YES” (and they should), you can understand how audience shapes the 
way we communicate with one another and should therefore keep this in mind as you write your essays. 
Writing Through Narrative  |  3
4  |  Writing Through Narrative
Unique Characteristics of the Narrative Essay 
SETH FRENCH 
Telling a Story vs. Exploring a Topic 
Most essays you have written up to this point in your academic career have likely introduced you to a certain topic 
and then asked you to explore that topic with three or more main points/examples/arguments. The narrative essay, in 
contrast, requires you to tell a story in order to communicate the specific message related to your writing topic. While 
there is certainly nothing wrong with other types of essays, it is vital that you approach this essay differently than how 
you approached others in order to successfully achieved a narrative style that is required. 
Once you receive your writing prompt, begin brainstorming by thinking about what experiences from your past relate 
to the particular topic you’re writing about. As you recall these experiences, try to narrow down the experiences you 
will include in your essay to the best one or two that you think would be most appropriate to write about. Since you are 
writing a narrative essay, not a narrative chapter or book, the more stories you include, the less detail you will be able 
to include because you will simply run out of space. So, it’s best to focus on one or two personal stories that correspond 
well with the writing prompt so you can go into as much detail as possible. 
Once you have selected the best personal example(s) you will write about, remember that you are telling a story, so 
your essay should include elements which are typically present in stories, such as the setting, characters, problem/
conflict, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution. While the level of detail you include regarding each of these 
elements will vary depending on your particular essay, be sure you don’t forget to discuss aspects that will help your 
reader better visualize the story you are telling them. 
Use of Personal Pronouns 
Language components of the narrative essay that separate it from other forms of writing are the common use of 
personal pronouns (I, me, my, we, our(s), mine), sensory language (taste, hear, smell, feel, see), dialogue, and the historical 
present / past tenses. Other forms of academic writing favor passive voice in which the agent is hidden and personal 
pronouns are limited, if not altogether absent. However, in the narrative essay you are sharing a personal experience 
with your audience, so it will sound most appropriate for you to use personal pronouns throughout your essay rather 
than use passive voice. In other words, if you were going to tell me about an event you attended with your friends, it 
would be more appropriate for you to say something such as, “We all had a really great time,” rather than, “A great time 
was had by everyone.” 
Use of Sensory Language 
Sensory language is often encouraged in narrative writing because it helps your audience bring themselves into your 
story as you share with them details that only you can tell them. When you read or hear some of your favorite stories, 
is it easy for you to visualize what the author is describing? If so, it is probably because the author is skilled at using 
sensory language to tell the story. While it is probably not necessary to include each of the five senses when you 
Unique Characteristics of the Narrative Essay  |  5
describe a particular event, you should consider which sensory details would be most useful for you to include in 
order to help your audience better visualize the setting(s) you describe. For instance, if your narrative setting were a 
concert, you would probably discuss the sights and sounds you experienced at that time as useful sensory details for 
your audience. On the other hand, if your narrative setting were a restaurant, it would perhaps make the most sense to 
discuss the smells and tastes you experienced. Thus, when you construct your narrative essay, consider which sensory 
details would be useful for you to include in order to more effectively engage your audience. 
Use of Dialogue 
The effective use of dialogue is another way of engaging your audience. Since your narrative essay contains characters 
who are interacting with one another, you should feel encouraged to share moments of dialogue within your narrative 
because it enables you to transition from simply telling your audience about what’s happening to actually immersing 
them in what’s happening. 
Think for a moment about the conversations you have with your friends on a regular basis. When you’re telling them 
about an interaction you had with someone else or an event you witnessed, you probably include the dialogue from that 
other situation without even realizing it. The reason we do this often instinctively is because we understand that stories 
with dialogue are generally more interesting than those without dialogue. 
For example, “When I was at Walmart the other day, I saw two men getting into an argument. The guy wearing the blue 
hat said, ‘I saw you trying to steal those. You better pay for them.’ Then the other guy said, ‘It’s none of your business.’ 
That made the guy in the blue hat mad, so he said, ‘You better pay for those, or else…’ They almost got into a fight. It 
made me really nervous to watch.” 
Now, compare that to the following example: “When I was at Walmart the other day, I saw a guy with a blue hat arguing 
with another guy because the other guy was stealing something. They argued back and forth and almost got into a fight. 
It made me really nervous to watch.” 
Which story is more intriguing, the first or the second? The first one, right? It’s funny how a small change like 
including dialogue can create such a significant difference in terms of engaging your audience. 
Use of Historical Present and Past Tenses 
Finally, the frequent use of historical present and past tense verbs also sets the narrative essay apart from other essays 
you may be used to writing. In many other academic writing contexts, present tense verbs are favored because they 
communicate general or ongoing events, truths, or realities. Present tense is a useful default tense to write in when your 
writing context is not particularly interested in the aspect of time. The narrative essay, in contrast, certainly emphasizes 
the aspect of time because you are telling a story which occurred in the past. Consequently, using the historical present 
or past tense to write about these events will work best in this context. 
The historical present tense is useful when you are discussing an event that occurred in the past but would like to 
convey a sense of immediacy with it, as the following example illustrates: “So, I am at my house, and guess who calls me 
. . . My boss! I was worried at first, but then she tells me that she wants to give me a promotion! Isn’t that great?” In this 
example, the speaker is telling her friend about the unexpected call she received from her boss while she was at home. 
Rather than using all past tense verbs, the speaker uses the historical present tense to describe this event, which makes 
her friend feel as though she is experiencing the event at that moment rather than simply hearing about it. 
Nevertheless, you should not feel as though you are restricted to using only these two verb tenses exclusively 
throughout your essay. Your thesis will likely be written using present tense verbs because your thesis will communicate 
6  |  Unique Characteristics of the Narrative Essay
some truth or realization you have learned through the experiences you share in your narrative. For example, if I were 
writing a narrative essay about a cultural tradition of the United States, I might write a thesis like this: “Celebrating 
Thanksgiving with my family reminds me that even though life can be hard and relationships can be complicated, I have 
so much to be thankful for.” As a general rule, use historical present or past tense verbs to discuss the events in your 
narrative which occurred in the past, and present tense verbs elsewhere. For more information regarding verb tense 
sequencing, refer to the appropriate link near the end of the “Impact of the Thesis” chapter under the “Useful Links” 
heading. 
Chronological Organization 
Since you are telling a story, it often makes the most sense to organize your essay chronologically in the order that 
the events happened. In other essays, you will likely organize your points/examples/arguments in the order of their 
importance or strength. The narrative essay, however, is easiest for your audience to follow if you structure the events 
chronologically. If your narrative contains two stories rather than one, either of the following organizational strategies 
can be effective: 
1. Oldest to most recent 
2. Most recent to oldest 
Whichever organizational strategy you select, make sure the last story you share is strong because it will be the last 
opportunity you have to leave your audience with a positive impression of your essay. 
Because the organization of the narrative is chronological, the transitional expressions you use within and between 
paragraphs will likely be chronological in nature as well. Consider using some of the following expressions and other 
similar expressions to transition from one event to the next as you construct your narrative essay: Then, Next, After that, 
Once that was over, When I/we had finished, Eventually, and Finally. Learning to use transitional expressions effectively 
will greatly enhance the quality of your writing.

The Impact of the Thesis 
SETH FRENCH 
Thoughts to Consider 
As with any essay you write, your thesis is one of the most important components of your essay. As such, it is vital that 
your thesis is clear and effectively addresses the writing prompt inside. For the narrative essay, your thesis will likely 
be a realization you have come to or perhaps a life lesson you have learned from the story you are writing about. We 
will discuss in a moment where in your essay you should include your thesis, but for now let’s consider other important 
thesis-related points to keep in mind as you compose your essay. 
Keep in mind that while you are telling a story with the narrative essay, the goal of your story is to support your 
thesis. Regardless of how interesting or well-written your story may be, if it fails to support your thesis then you will 
need to make significant revisions to it before submitting your final draft. When some students struggle to develop a 
working thesis, they choose to simply construct the rest of their essay and then create their thesis later. This is not a 
wise strategy. Your thesis should determine how you construct your essay, not vice versa. Thus, determining your thesis 
should be one of your first objectives to complete in the composition process. Once you have your thesis, you may still 
need to refine it throughout the drafting process, but the general idea of your thesis will likely remain the same. 
As you compose the various parts of your essay throughout the drafting process, you should repeatedly ask yourself, 
“How does this support my thesis?” If you respond to this question honestly as you draft, you will be able to identify 
the strengths of your essay as well as the weaknesses and address them accordingly. Failing to support your thesis is 
generally the result of your details being insufficient, irrelevant, and/or incoherent. Therefore, if you are concerned 
that you have not adequately supported your thesis in a particular portion of your essay, ensure that your details are 
sufficient, relevant to your thesis, and coherently organized. 
You may include your thesis in either the introduction or the conclusion of your essay. To help you choose where it 
would be best to include it for your particular essay, keep the following considerations in mind. 
Thesis in Introduction 
Including your thesis in the introduction is common across virtually all academic writing contexts because it helps you 
establish a clear focus early in the essay and gives your audience a general idea of what your essay is about before 
reading it in its entirety. Often you will find the thesis as either the first sentence or the last sentence in the introduction, 
although including it as the last sentence of your introduction is more common and often preferred. Your introduction 
does not need to be very long because the majority of what you communicate to your audience will be in the body of 
your essay, but it should contain the following aspects: hook/attention getter, optional development sentence(s), and a 
thesis. 
The first sentence of your essay is often called an attention getter or hook because you want to get your audience’s 
attention (or “hook” them) from the very beginning. Hooks can come in the form of thoughtful questions, relevant 
statistics, intriguing quotes, or simply a well-crafted sentence. Thus, if you include your thesis as your very first 
sentence, make sure it is something that will engage your audience because you don’t want your audience to lose 
interest in what you have to say. Then, the only other components you would need to include in the introduction are 
development sentences if you feel that your audience needs a bit more information before you begin telling them your 
8  |  The Impact of the Thesis
story. On the other hand, if your thesis is the last sentence in your introduction, your structure will be hook, optional 
development sentence(s), then thesis. When using this structure, just try to make sure that your thesis transitions 
logically into your first body paragraph. 
Your body paragraphs are where you will tell your audience the story that makes up the majority of your narrative 
essay. As previously mentioned, be very intentional as you compose this story because you are not simply telling a story 
aimlessly; you are telling a story to support your thesis. After you’ve written your body paragraphs, all that’s left is your 
conclusion, which should restate your thesis (using slightly different wording) and offer any last insights you would like 
to leave your audience with that you have not communicated elsewhere in your essay. 
Below is a list of pros and cons for this essay structure that you should consider as you determine which structure 
works best for you. 
Pros: 
• 
An introduction with a thesis makes it clear to your audience for your essays about without reading 
your essay in its entirety. 
• 
With your thesis in the introduction, you can reference it as you develop your essay and ensure that 
each body paragraph supports your thesis coherently 
• 
Because this structure is common in many other academic writing contexts, you may have written 
this is similar structure in the past and find it easier to construct than the alternative. 
 
Cons: 
• 
It can be difficult to engage your audience throughout the essay if you tell them the overall message 
you want to hear at the beginning rather than at the end. 
• 
It does not follow the typical structure of a story throughout: setting, characters, problem/conflict, 
rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution. Instead, both the introduction and conclusion 
contain elements of your resolution, and the other elements are more or less confined to your body 
paragraphs. 
• 
• Because it does not follow the typical structure of a story, you may be tempted to simply write an 
essay with several main points that come in the form of story-like examples rather than telling a story 
as you should for the narrative essay. 
Thesis in Conclusion 
Including your thesis solely in your conclusion is less common than the alternative in most academic writing contexts. 
Nevertheless, it corresponds to the typical structure of a story and is therefore perhaps more appropriate to use for the 
narrative essay. As you draft, you may find it helpful to think about some of your favorite stories from books, television 
shows, and/or movies and consider how they are structured. It is essential that you do not simply include a story with 
a moral at the end of it where the story’s details are unrelated, but rather be intentional in the details you share so that 
they are directly tied to your thesis in the conclusion. 
As in the previous section, a list of pros and cons for this essay structure is included below to help you decide which 
The Impact of the Thesis  |  9
structure works best for you. You may notice that the pros from the previous section correspond in some ways to the 
cons of this section, and vice versa. 
Pros: 
• 
This structure corresponds to the typical structure of stories where the resolution that the 
audience is left with comes near the end rather than the beginning. As a result, it is perhaps easier to 
engage your reader throughout the essay because they are waiting until the end for the story’s 
resolution. 
• 
Following this structure almost ensures that your essay will be a narrative essay and that you won’t 
be deducted points for writing a narrative-like essay that does not adequately meet the requirements 
of this genre. 
Cons: 
• 
You may not have experience composing essays with this structure and therefore find it more 
difficult to write than the alternative. 
• 
If you are not careful, your essay could seem somewhat aimless without a clear thesis in the 
introduction, and only seem clear when you reach the resolution at the end. Thus, you must be all the 
more intentional about the details you share leading up to your thesis and have a clear thesis in mind 
as you draft to ensure the remainder of your essay supports it.

is dedicated to helping you revise by showing you what specific outcomes you should aim for with your final draft. The 
outcomes are broken down by category and are listed in the form of questions you should ask yourself when you have 
finished your first draft. 
Content 
• Do you have a clear thesis that is strong supported by your narrative? 
• Are the details in your narrative cleared relevant? 
• Is your narrative thoroughly developed or does it lack certain necessary points or narrative structure features 
(setting, climax, resolution, etc.)? 
Organization 
• Does your sequence of events and details clear and logical progression? 
• Does your essay have a clear focus both within each paragraph (coherence) and across your essay as a whole 
(unity)?

Thesis in Introduction: Based on an Essay by Xihong Su 
Essay Prompt:  Overall, has technology made your life better or worse? Think of specific moments in your life that 
illustrate how your relationship with technology has developed throughout your life in order to answer this question. 
Keep in mind that you’re not just telling a story. You’re writing an essay to support your response and using stories from 
your life to illustrate your answer. You should incorporate details to highlight your point and engage a reader’s interest. 
Your essay should be approximately 750 words. 
The Internet Has Made My Life Better 
While walking around campus, many students access the Internet by phone. They may chat with other people and 
play games. While attending class, we may participate in class activities and upload homework to D2L on the Internet. If 
there were no Internet, what would happen? Whether you recognize that the Internet has changed our lives or not, the 
Internet does change our lives. In my opinion, the Internet has made my life better. 
The Internet has changed the way that I can communicate with friends. I left my hometown and went to the first 
university about fifteen years ago. I was excited that I could make new friends and learn new knowledge from the 
university. However, I missed my friends who were in other cities. I often mailed letters with some photos to my friends 
and told them something interesting in campus and kept in touch with them. It often took several days or one week 
to receive letters. Sometimes, a letter might be lost. In June 2001, to my joy, there was a public computer room where 
students could access the Internet in the university. In the first few months, the computer room was full of students all 
day long. At the same time, the Internet chat tool, QQ, became very popular among students. When my friends and I 
were all available, I used QQ to chat with them face to face and heard their voices and saw their facial expressions. How 
wonderful the Internet was! In addition, sending an email partly took the place of mailing a letter. I composed messages 
with some digital pictures and sent them to my friend in an email. An email was almost instant and helped me learn 
about information from friends as soon as possible. Now, I can post my latest information and pictures in my Facebook 
that is a worldwide network service. All my friends in Facebook can see the information and comment on it and share it. 
The Internet provides me a lot of helpful information. First, as a student, I need to write some essays and research 
papers. For example, one assignment I had was to write about King David. I searched the keywords “King David” in 
relative databases in the OSU library and chose several papers that were most relative to King David. I also input “King 
David” in Wikipedia and saw relative descriptions of King David from different perspectives. These published electronic 
resources really helped me write a thoroughly researched paper. 
Second, after one day of classes, I wanted to make healthy and delicious foods in my dormitory. Before buying foods, 
I looked for nutrition information of foods and decided which kind of foods I would buy. After I prepared my food 
materials, YouTube videos of cooking foods guided me to cook foods step by step. No matter what level my cooking skills 
were, if I followed the guidance I would make delicious foods. 
Third, because I like relaxing myself on holiday, traveling could be very important in my life. Before traveling, I may 
try to find as much information as I can on the Internet, such as weather, transportation, hotels, ticket prices and local 
foods. There are also travel guides and comments from other people who have been to scenic spots. Comments and 
relative information helped me make a better traveling plan about three years ago. My husband and I spent one month 
in traveling across half of China and enjoyed the travel. Therefore, there are a lot of electronic resources on the Internet. 
It may be very difficult for me to get much useful information without the Internet in a short time. 
The Internet gives me more entertainment as well. First, there are many games that people can play together on the 
Internet, such as Popkart. I liked playing Popkart about four years ago. I did not need to worry about the speed limit or 
Sample Narrative Essays  |  13
accidents that a car might cause while I was driving a car in the game. Second, many entertainment performances can 
be found on the Internet. It may not be easy to see some live performances on TV, such as TV shows. However, I can find 
TV Shows on the Internet and see them many times. 
The Internet enables me to communicate with other people in an effective way. It provides a lot of electronic 
information and increases the speed of obtaining information that I want. It also enriches my life. Therefore, the Internet 
has really made my life better.

“You’ve gotta’ try this!” 
My obsession with trying different types of food began in my dad’s second floor apartment in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The 
apartment was “cool” because it was on the second floor. It had stone steps leading upward to the small patio and 
doorway that was teeming with many varieties of potted plants. A person passing by could see the soft blanket of 
colors that the flowers made against the railing of the patio – an urban jungle. My dad always had an interest in things 
that many, who are familiar with gender roles, would call “feminine.” These interests and passions consisted of potted 
plants, metro-sexual fashion, wine, and of course, fine cuisine. My dad was the type of person who would go to the 
grocery store to buy the freshest ingredients possible to try out the most recent recipe he had read in either his French 
or German cookbook. He also enjoyed coming home with the most foul-smelling cheese you can imagine because 
according to him “the stinky cheese is the best!” This sense of culinary adventure also extended into our experiences on 
the nights when dad didn’t feel like cooking. 
Dad always had a way of finding what he called a “hole-in-the-wall place.” He always told me that “the hole-in-the-wall 
places always have the best food!” and boy, did we live by this mantra. We often found ourselves at restaurants where 
we were the only pair that spoke English. We would end up in the Mexican part of town at restaurants with the most 
delicious, authentic food in town. We would also go to many different Asian restaurants and on special occasions, we 
ended up at the nicest French restaurant in town and ate delicious, buttery escargot and flaky bread. 
My most vivid memory of adventuring into the world of food occurred at a small, “hole-in-the-wall” Japanese 
restaurant called Ichiban. I was seven years old, and I loved Pokémon. The place was barely even visible from the road. 
When you walked through the ordinary glass, you found yourself inside of the elegant world of Ichiban. Little red 
cushioned chairs were neatly placed around square wooden tables. The red cushions gained even more vibrancy due to 
the overall reddish glow of the restaurant’s interior. A soft, red lighting beamed from lanterns that seemed to float in the 
air, like lonely balloons that had been left behind after escaping a child’s clutch. Bottles of Kikkoman brand soy sauce 
found their homes atop the square wooden tables, and seemed to accessorize the little red cushioned chairs. When we 
were seated, I did as any restaurant patron does: I looked at the menu and sipped on the glass of ice water in front of 
me. 
As I was exploring the menu my dad leaned over and said to me: “You’ve gotta’ try Tako salad!” The first thing I thought 
of when my dad said “Tako salad” was the yummy combination of ground beef, cheese, pico de gallo, salsa, a dollop of 
sour cream and various toppings of the consumer’s choosing, that would all be served up in a crunchy, taco shell bowl. 
Thus the name “Taco salad.” When my dad asked me to try a food, I was always expected to give the dish a try. I was 
never that kid who got chicken or spaghetti at every restaurant. 
I was a fearless and open-minded child who could never be labeled as picky eater. When my dad said we had to try the 
Tako salad, I of course agreed to order it. When it arrived, I realized that this was not the Taco salad I had envisioned.

In front of me was a pure white bowl in the shape of a flower. In its center were colorful bits of cucumber with sesame 
seeds, fresh strips of something soft and green, and glistening pieces of white edged in pinkish purple. My dad was 
smiling at me. 
I picked up my chopsticks and put one of the thin white slices into my mouth. It was strange, chewy, 
vinegary….delicious! We had ordered Tako Sun, cold octopus and vegetables in a sweet, savory vinegar sauce. That day 
at Ichiban, a miraculous transformation happened: a seven year old girl, who loved Pokémon and was seated on a red 
cushioned chair, fell in love with Asian cuisine. I began to make connections between food and culture. Japan is an island 
nation surrounded by bodies of water. With this abundance of water, the Japanese enjoy many seafood dishes that are 
not typically served in other cultures. One of those strange creatures is octopus. The simple elegant furnishings of the 
restaurant and the beautiful white bowl and the elegant arrangement of each item in it spoke of the Japanese attention 
to meticulous detail and fondness for precise rituals. 
I am forever grateful to my dad for taking me out of my comfort zone. He made me give different and exotic foods a 
try. This did something even deeper for me than tantalize my taste buds: it made me love and appreciate cultures other 
than my own. Food is now the focal point of my experience with other cultures, and I have blossomed into a lifelong 
cross-cultural “foodie” thanks to the simple phrase my dad loved to say: “You’ve gotta’ try this!”

WRITING FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES 
At the University much of the writing that you do will be for the purpose of communicating information. In some cases, 
you will write to demonstrate your own understanding of specific information. For example, in exams or assignments 
you may be asked to explain or summarize information that you have read or heard in class. In other cases, you will 
write to inform others about a topic on which you have gathered information. Examples of this include reports about 
experiences, surveys or lab activities, as well as papers in which you read sources and describe previous research on a 
particular topic. 
Because the specific purposes and audiences for informational writing vary greatly, it is important to pay close 
attention to the assignment and to consider who the proposed audience is for your writing. The key to writing to convey 
information effectively is to understand the point of view and previous knowledge of your reader. If the audience is 
your instructor, make sure that you understand his or her expectations. Carefully read any information your instructor 
provides about the assignment and make sure you understand what criteria the instructor will use to evaluate it. If the 
instructor provides a rubric or a grading sheet, look at this before you start writing, and think about how you can best 
shape your writing to fit the guidelines. 
If the writing assignment has a different audience, you should try to find as much information about your possible 
readers as you can. You need especially to consider how much the possible readers know about your topic and try to 
match the amount and type of information you provide to what those particular readers need to supplement what they 
already know. For example, if you were writing about a concept or idea in your major for advanced students in that 
major, you would assume that they already know something about basic information in the field. On the other hand, if 
you are reading to introduce first-year students to the same topic, you would need to provide much more background 
information. You might need to explain unfamiliar terms, give more details, or explain more specifically what links one 
point to another. 
FOCUS: Reader’s Knowledge & Point of View 
1. 
Assume that you are writing for a person of your own age from your own country. Describe your 
favorite food from your home country. 
2. 
Assume that you are writing for an American university student who has never been to your 
country. Describe your favorite food from your home country. 
Compare your two descriptions. How are they different? Why? 
 
Writing for Information Purposes  |  17
18  |  Writing for Information Purposes
Writing from Readings: Definitions and Examples 
CAROL LYNN MODER 
In academic settings, writers commonly base the content of their writing on materials they have read.  For example, an 
instructor might ask you to describe or discuss specific information from an assigned reading (see Example 1). The first 
step to approach this writing task is to carefully read the assignment in order to make sure you understand what it will 
require. 
 
Example 1: 
Using information from The Cultural Feast and other assigned readings, Define ethnocentrism and 
cultural relativism. Provide specific examples of your reactions to the readings that might be instances of 
each. 
 
This assignment indicates that the instructor expects you to use one key reading, called The Cultural Feast and other 
related readings to answer the question. The assignment makes clear that you need to have read these texts carefully 
and to refer to the text in your answer. So how do you refer to those texts correctly? 
Informal In-Text Citations 
As you saw in earlier chapters, there are a variety of ways to refer to another text in your writing. For many kinds 
of writing, you will have to use a formal documentation style, like APA, for your in-text citations and you will have to 
provide a reference page, as well. And other kinds of writing, particularly if you are referring to readings assigned for a 
class or if you are writing in a magazine or newspaper style, you may be allowed or expected to use a more informal way 
of referring to a text. You should check in with your instructor about which approach he or she expects you to use. 
Note that the assignment in example one refers to the key text as The Cultural Feast. Here the instructor uses the title 
of the text and puts it in italics. The italics show this is the title of the book. Know if you are writing by hand, you would 
underline the title of the book, The Cultural Feast, since you can’t put it in italics. The title of an article or chapter would 
usually be put in quotation marks. In answer 2, we see this in the use of  “Eating as a Cultural Affair.” In this example, the 
writer puts the title in parentheses and gives the specific page number, a variation on a more formal in-text citation. If 
the instructor uses an informal citation in the question, it is probable that you can use it in your response. Remember, 
though, that it is always a good idea to ask the instructor what in-text citation format he or she expects. 
A second in-text citation strategy is to use the name of the author of the article or book. We see this in Answer 1, 
where the student writes: “In Davidson’s article…” 
 
Writing from Readings: Definitions and Examples  |  19
Examples of informal in-text citations 
In The Cultural Feast, ethnocentrism is defined as… 
→Title of book in italics 
The chapter, “Eating is a Cultural Affair” describes… 
→Title of chapter in quotes 
Bryant, DeWalt, Courtney & Schwartz highlight “ “ 
→Authors’ last names 
According to Bryant and colleagues,…. 
→First author’s name, ‘colleagues’ used to avoid listing multiple authors 
 
The two most important aspects of citing texts to display knowledge are to be sure that: 1) you refer explicitly to 
each specific reading you mentioned and 2) you make very clear when you are paraphrasing ideas or examples from the 
readings. 
Reading the assignment CAREFULLY 
The most important part of writing to display knowledge is to read the assignment VERY CAREFULLY and make sure 
you understand how many parts the question has and what they are. The most common mistake that students make on 
such writing tasks is to read the question too quickly and, as a result, answer only part of it. The assignment in Example 
1 asks the student to do two main tasks: DEFINE and PROVIDE SPECIFIC EXAMPLES. 
This is a typical format for some reading-based assignments and exam questions. In the two sample answers below, 
we find two different ways of organizing the response. In Answer 1, the writer addresses the first part of the question, 
defining the first term in the first sentence into the second term in the second sentence. The writer then provides 
examples in the following sentences. This answer follows the order of the question – defining first and then providing 
examples. In short answers of this kind, it is critical for the writer to make clear how he or she is connecting each 
definition to the examples. One way to do this is to repeat key terms from the question to show clearly how the examples 
illustrate the terms. 
Look at Answer 1 and underline each place where the writer uses the key terms ethnocentrism and 
cultural relativism or a variation of those terms. Why does the writer repeat the terms in those places? 
 
In this kind of writing, you need to be very clear which examples show the meaning of each term. Remember that you 
are writing to display your own understanding of the terms. You should not leave it to the reader to guess. 
 
Answer 1 
Ethnocentrism is one’s belief that they are superior and they judge other cultures based on the values and 
standards of their own culture. Cultural Relativism is the idea that a person’s beliefs or behavior should be 
understood by others in terms of that person’s own culture. When reading about eating insects in Eating is a 
Cultural Affair, my initial reaction was that it was gross and weird but I realized that I was being 
ethnocentric, rejecting the idea because it is odd in our culture. After stopping to think, when I tried to be 
more culturally relativistic, I realize that it is a common occurrence in many cultures in the insects can 
actually be a good source of protein. In Davidson’s article, he describes the Europeans as having 
ethnocentric reactions to the new foods that were brought back from the Americas. They quickly adopted 
the new beans, because they were similar to some European varieties, but the stranger, unfamiliar foods, 
like tomatoes and potatoes, were viewed with suspicion and even assumed to be poisonous. The description 
of body images in The Cultural Feast takes a cultural relativism viewpoint, describing the health and beauty 
Writing from Readings: Definitions and Examples  |  21
values that led traditional Polynesians to prefer fat bodies. We may not agree that obesity is beautiful, but 
we can try to understand how the Polynesians can see it that way. 
 
Answer 2 
• 
Ethnocentrism: viewing others cultures to your culture’s lens and assuming that other cultures are 
inferior to yours. “The uncritical acceptance of one’s own value system and lifestyle as the most 
appropriate.” (“Eating is a Cultural Affair,” page 100) 
Example: In colonial times, British people looks down on South African people for their 
Reliance on cassava since it is low in nutrition but didn’t require much cultivation, so they 
called it the “lazy man’s crop” and discouraged its cultivation. This reduced food security a bit, 
etc. (“Eating is a Cultural Affair,” page 100) 
 
• 
Cultural Relativism: (reverse of ethnocentrism) Viewing each culture as adequately equal to each 
other in value and vests understandable within its own set of beliefs and values.

Writing from Data 
CAROL LYNN MODER 
Many academic writing tasks require you to present information that you have gathered or that you have been given in 
to explain or interpret the information. One common way of presenting data is to use a table. 
Many beginning writers simply take the tables that they get from a database or statistical package and insert them 
into their writing, but this practice is not usually very effective. When you present data in a table you should consider 
whether the way you have labeled and organized it will be understandable to your audience. You should also consider 
what your purpose as a writer is. Why are you presenting this information? What is the main idea that you want to 
convey? Even when we are presenting numerical data, we as writers need to consider that the thesis of the writing is 
and how we can make it clear to the audience. One important way of making sure the information in a table is clear is to 
provide good labels. 
TABLE 1: Health Statistics 2002 – 2003 
France 
USA 
Life Expectancy 
72 years 
69.3 years 
Percent overweight (Body Mass Index ≥25) 
Men 
49% 
68% 
Women 
35% 
51% 
 
Consider Table 1. The title on the table “Health Statistics 2002-2003” gives the reader a very general idea of the kind 
of information the table will contain and the dates it was collected, but it does not help the reader to understand what 
the writer’s main point is in presenting the table. What does the writer want the reader to focus on? By looking at the 
headings for the columns on the right “France” and “USA,” we can guess that the writer’s focus is a comparison of the 
two countries. The information in the rows suggests that the comparison will be related to “life expectancy” and the 
“percent” of the population that were “overweight.” By looking at these labels we can figure out what the purpose of the 
comparison might be, but it would be much more effective if the writer put a title on the table that made its purpose 
explicit. 
 
FOCUS: Labelling Tables 
Brainstorm some better titles for Table 1. Consider how each title might indicate the writer’s main 
purpose. 
Why do you think the information about France is in the first column? What does the order of the 
columns suggest to you about the writer’s focus? 
 
The second key way to use the presentation of data to support your main purpose is to explain the information in the 
Writing from Data  |  23
table is clearly in the text of the writing. Do not assume that a reader will look at the table and understand it the way 
you intend. 
 
FOCUS: Comparing for a purpose 
Look at Table 1 and write three statements that use the information in the table to compare France and 
the USA. 
Think about the three statements you have written. How could you use them to develop a thesis? What 
would the thesis be? 
 
The information in table 1 comes from an article by Paul Rozin in which he examines what has been called “The 
French Paradox.” From an American point of view, the paradox is that the French appear to eat food that is rich and 
high in cholesterol – including cream, high-fat cheeses, and meats – but they seem to be healthier than Americans. 
Since Americans generally believe that diet is a main factor in health and disease and since many diet experts in the U.S. 
recommend low-fat diets, this combination of a rich diet and good health appears puzzling. To investigate the paradox, 
Rozin and his colleagues conducted a survey of the attitudes about food of French and American college students. Some 
of the survey results appear in Table 2. In Table 2, we provide the very specific title of the table that Rozin used in his 
article. Note how clearly it defines the source of the information and its purpose. The box below gives an example of 
how the results of the table could be described in the text to highlight the main purpose of the writer.

In text description of Table 2 (based on Rozin 2005, p. S2010) 
 
Table 2 illustrates some major differences in French and American attitudes toward food and eating. For 
example, compared with the French study participants, much higher percentages of participants in the 
United States associated the words “heavy cream” with “unhealthy.” More Americans said that they would 
prefer consuming an inexpensive nutrient pill to eating. Americans were also much more likely than the 
French to prefer, at the same price, a week at a luxury hotel with average food over a modest hotel with 
gourmet food. Overall, we found that for our survey participants, compared with Americans, the French 
seem to consider eating good food a more important part of life than Americans do.

Variation and Complexity 
CAROL LYNN MODER 
When making comparisons between and among groups, you need to be careful not to make over-generalizations. For 
example, you would not want to say “French people are healthier than Americans” or “Americans do not care about the 
quality of their food.” In all groups there is some variation and a writer needs to be sure to limit big generalizations to 
avoid stereotypes that suggest every member of a group is the same. 
First, you need to be careful NOT to assume that the people who responded to the survey represent all Americans or 
all French people. For one thing, the respondents were college students. Older people in each country or less educated 
people might or might not respond similarly. If you are writing from your own experience, you need to be careful in the 
same way not to assume that the people you have met are just like everyone else in their group. If you are writing about 
general assumptions that people have about different groups, you should be aware that all general statements about a 
group are likely to be stereotypes that ignore vast variation and differences. 
Secondly, even within each group of the college students surveyed in this example, there is variation. If we look again 
at the percentage in Table 2, we can see that none of the answers had 100% responses. Though a larger percent of 
Americans than French surveyed said they would prefer to give up eating and take a pill instead, it is worth noting that 
only 27% of Americans said this, compared to 10% of the French respondents. So, the vast majority of Americans, even 
in this survey, (73%) said they would not want to do this, as did 90% of the French. If we think about the percentages in 
this way, we could accurately say that the responses show that the great majority of Americans agreed with the great 
majority of the French respondents in this question. 
 
Limited Findings 
Look back at the in-text citation for Table 2, and underline the words the writer uses to restrict the 
findings only to the amount of difference in the data: 
• 
much higher than 
• 
much more likely than 
• 
more 
• 
for our survey participants 
• 
seem to 
 
On the other hand, for the hotel question, 77% of Americans prefer the luxury hotel, whereas only 11% of the French 
agreed. Here the difference between groups is much bigger, so we could be more confident about saying that most of 
the Americans responded differently than most of the French. Even so, we should still keep in mind that 23% of the 
Americans agreed with the 89% of the French who would rather have a modest hotel and good food. This means we 
could not say “Americans don’t care about food,” since almost one-fourth of the Americans in the survey said they did 
care more about food than a fancy hotel. We have to be careful to draw conclusions that fit the evidence and are not too 
general. If you are making a comparison that is not based on actual data, you need to be even more careful to limit your 
statements about each group.

Table 4 comes from another article by Paul Rozin 
1. In this article, he reports the responses of college students in India 
and the USA two questions about Traditional Values concerning obeying and respecting parents and Elders. Note that 
the responses suggests some contrast in the American and Indian responses, but also show a lot of variation within the 
groups. The responses are also separated by gender, suggesting that the author expected some possible variation among 
males and females in each group.

Organizing an Essay 
CAROL LYNN MODER 
When you are asked to write longer assignments, you will need to consider what your topic will be and what you want 
to say about it. In many academic contexts, longer assignments may be in the form of an informational essay that will 
present several points in support of one main idea about the topic. The writer’s main purpose is normally stated in a 
thesis statement. Depending on the type of essay you are writing and your purpose, you may have a choice of whether 
to put your thesis statement in the introduction or in the conclusion. In informational essays, most American academic 
audiences prefer you to state the main purpose of the essay explicitly at the end of the introduction. 
When a thesis statement appears in the introduction, it not only states the writer’s purpose, but typically it also gives 
the reader a preview of the main points of the essay and the order in which the writer will present them. For example, if 
the thesis statement is: “in this paper I will discuss the three main factors that affect success in college prior education, 
motivation, and the time devoted to assignments,” the reader expects you to discuss these three factors IN THE ORDER 
YOU MENTIONED them: 
1. Prior education 
2. Motivation 
3. Time devoted to assignments. 
You should give some thought to what order will be most effective for the information you are presenting. Be sure that 
your thesis statement presents that order clearly and then follows that order in the body of the paper. 
Following the introduction, it is typical to present each of your main points in a single unified paragraph. The most 
coherent way to organize the paragraphs in your writing is to introduce each paragraph with a TOPIC SENTENCE. As 
its name suggests, the topic sentence is usually a single sentence that states the topic, that is, the main point that the 
paragraph will illustrate or discuss. 
 
Sample Thesis Statement & Topic Sentences: 
Thesis Statement: 
In this paper I will discuss the three main factors that affect success in college: prior education, motivation, 
and time devoted to assignments. 
 
Paragraph 1 Topic Sentence: 
Most research concerning success in college focuses on the importance of a student’s prior educational 
background. 
 
Paragraph 2 Topic Sentence: 
Although prior educational background plays an important role, the amount and type of motivation that a 
student has can make a greater difference in college success. 
28  |  Organizing an Essay
 
Paragraph 3 Topic Sentence: 
A final important factor in Student Success is the amount of time a student actually devotes two 
assignments. 
 
 
If we consider the sample thesis statement and topic sentences, we see that they have more than one function. As we 
have said, they explicitly state the main point or points of the essay, but they also help the reader to understand how the 
writing will develop. They tell the reader what to look for in the writing. These sentences are like directions you give to 
help a person find a particular place. If you give clear directions that highlight the upcoming turn in the road, it makes it 
easier for the reader to follow the path of your thoughts. A third important function of the thesis statements and topic 
sentences is to make connections and show the relationships among the points. If we look at the sample topic sentences 
for paragraphs 2 and 3, we see that they use words that make connections to other ideas in the writing. The words and 
phrases involved in the sample help the reader to follow the path of the argument and make sure that the reader is on 
the right road. Using these connecting phrases leads readers to understand how you, the writer, wants them to put their 
ideas together. 
Once you have introduced the main point of a paragraph or the topic sentence, you then must develop the paragraph 
with examples, details, or anecdotes to illustrate and develop the point. The kind of details or examples you use depend 
on the purpose and requirements of the assignment. 
After you provide these examples, you may want to continue to help the reader to follow your reasoning, by the end 
of the paragraph for the summarizing sentence or two that connects the example to the overall purpose of the essay. 
Such sentences are sometimes called “wrap & tie” sentences. If your paragraph is a package that contains one of the 
main ideas, the final sentence wraps up the package and ties a nice bow on top. The purpose is to make sure your reader 
understands how you want him or her to interpret your examples and what conclusions you intend. If you do not use 
a wrap and tie sentence, you are leaving the “package” open and your reader can put whatever he or she wants inside. 
In American academic writing, readers usually expect a writer to make his or her interpretation is clear and explicit as 
possible. 
When you have developed your writing with an introduction and the appropriate number of body paragraphs, you 
then need to draw a final conclusion. The conclusion typically appears in a separate paragraph. Like “wrap & tie” 
sentences, the purpose of the conclusion is to direct the reader to the interpretation that you intend. The most basic 
conclusion reiterates the main points of the writing. It may also highlight some of the key examples. It must connect 
these to the purpose stated in the thesis statement and draw a final conclusion. 
As with all kinds of academic writing, before you begin to develop your content you should look carefully at the 
assignment. Sample assignment 2 requires the writer to develop content about food that would compare and contrast 
food practices in the US with food practices in his or her home country. To gather information about American food 
practices, each student interviewed an American student. The assignment requires the writer to use information from 
the interview. The purpose of the comparison is to relate food practices to cultural or individual identity. It requires 
students to use three themes from the interview to illustrate the main point.

Sample Introduction 1 
What Food Tells us about the US and Saudi Arabia 
Societies are often complicated to any stranger. They are hard to understand completely for an individual 
who does not live in that society, yet there is a way to understand them. The products of a society tell a lot 
about it. For example, artists express the views, ideas, beliefs and important issues of their society using 
their passion in doing certain art. Music, paintings, statues, and poetry convey the background of an artist. 
Such works of art carry an enormous amount of information that need to be analyzed by an expert, which 
brings us back to the complexity issue again. Foods are the products of each society that can be easily 
understood. According to Rozin, (2005) food takes a wider role than just nutrition, and identifies where 
people are from and what ethnicity they are. Food and food practices tell a lot about one’s culture and 
identity (p. 108). Cooking food, just like art, explains many aspects of a society but in a simpler way. To 
gather information about American food and culture, I interviewed Mike, an American student. Through the 
conversation, the similarities and differences between the two cultures, his and mine, emerged. Food 
cuisines are significantly impacted by immigration in both Saudi Arabia and the United States. Also, in both 
countries there are foods that are associated with particular events and celebrations. However the 
involvement of fathers in food is different from that in the United States.

Sample Body Paragraph 1: Differences of Food Between Different Countries 
Immigrants bring their cuisines with them to the country they move to. In the US the number of 
Organizing an Essay  |  31
immigrants is enormous. It is almost a country that was populated by immigrants and it is the country 
where the salad bowl metaphor is perfectly applied. Their food cuisine is a mixture of different cuisines 
from around the globe. For example, Mexican, Italian, Chinese and Japanese dishes are popular in the US. 
When I asked Mike to tell me more about the cuisine in his home state of Florida he said: 
Since the Spanish came to Florida originally you have that influence. So you have Spanish cuisine 
there. You also have a lot of people from New York who come down to Florida to retire because the 
weather is a lot nicer in Florida, so they Regional food is common. 
According to Mike, immigration plays a role in Florida’s cuisine. Similarly, Saudi Arabia is a country where 
Muslims from around the world come to practice rituals throughout the course of the year. Moreover, some 
stay for the rest of their lives in Saudi Arabia. Also, a small fraction of the immigrants come to work in Saudi 
Arabia. Those immigrants, just like others, bring their own unique dishes with them. They become popular 
with time. For instance, Egyptian, Moroccan, Pakistani, and Indian dishes are common in Saudi Arabia. 
Although the numbers of immigrants vary, both countries have been impacted in the same manner.

The US and Saudi Arabia have similarities and differences when it comes to food and food practices. Both 
had an immigration era that impacted their food significantly. Also, both countries link food items to special 
occasions, which tells a lot about their past and roots. Finally food preparation responsibilities and habits 
are different, conveying that the family structure and dominance are different too. To sum this up, food is a

Sample Comparative Essay 
Changing Food Practices in Saudi Arabia and the U.S. 
Informative Title 
Food practices illustrate a complex relationship between tradition, environment, and individual 
behavior. College students show this relationship well because they often make adjustments in 
their food habits when they are away from home in a new place. In this paper, I will describe my 
food experiences in Saudi Arabia and in the US and compare my experiences to those of Peter, an 
American student I interviewed. Our experiences show that food is shaped by traditional culture 
and family but new environments can lead to change in individual food practices. 
Introduction 
Topic Overview 
Describe Method 
Thesis Statement 
Food practices are usually based on what we learn from our culture and our families. And Saudi 
Arabia, my family’s food practices followed typical Saudi Arabian gender roles. My father was 
responsible for purchasing food at the local market, but all the food preparation was done by my 
mother and three sisters. Because of these typical roles, I never cooked when I was at home. In 
my interview with Peter, he said that some American families followed similar traditional roles, 
where the mother was responsible for all the cooking, but he said that in other families he knew 
the father did a lot of cooking. And his family, his mother was the main preparer of food, but his 
father sometimes cook special items, like chili or grilled steak. Even so, like me, he never learned 
to cook when he was at home. From this, we can see that each of our families followed a pattern 
of food preparation that was common in our culture. 
Body Paragraph 1 
Topic Sentence 
 
Example: Saudi Arabia 
 
Example: USA 
 
 
Wrap & Tie Sentence 
Although our food preparation practices come from our family and culture, new environments 
can lead to change. When I got to America, I could not find any traditional Arabic foods where I 
was living. I really missed those foods. I decided that the only way to satisfy my longing was to 
learn how to cook some traditional dishes myself. I called my mother and asked her to tell me 
how to cook some simple items. Soon, I was cooking lunch for myself everyday. When I was in 
Saudi Arabia, I didn’t like to cook, but now I cook, because I want to eat the famous dishes from 
Saudi Arabia. Since Peter is studying in his home country, he is able to find foods he likes, but he 
said that he misses some of the foods that his family used to cook. The food on campus is not as 
tasty as the food he had at home. He called father and asked him to tell him how to cook chili. 
Peter does not cook it everyday, but sometimes he cooks it on the weekend as a special treat. 
From this we see that each of us has adapted to our new college environment by learning how to 
cook. For me, this was new, since men do not usually cook and Saudi Arabia. Peter learned how to 
cook the dish his father made, so for him the adjustment was not so big. Both of us enjoy this 
change and plan to continue cooking.

Wrap & Tie Sentence 
A new environment can also lead to changes in social food practices. Here at university in the 
United States, the way people eat and interact is very different from what I did in Saudi Arabia. In 
Saudi Arabia eating is part of social gatherings. Families sit together during meals, and you also 
eat with your friends. In the US, most of the time I eat alone. If I ask someone to eat with me, that 
person is often too busy. Peter said that at home he was also used to eating meals with his family 
at dinner time, but for breakfast and lunch he just ate something fast. At the university, he seldom 
sits down for a real meal. Usually, he just picks up something quick and eats it on his way 
somewhere. He says that he and his friends are usually too busy to eat, which is why they eat so 
much fast food. Both Peter and I eat on our own a lot here at the university. This does not seem 
to bother Peter, maybe because he thinks it is a typical American thing to do. For me, I don’t like 
the change. Eating with friends and family is too important for me to give up the Saudi custom 
easily. One way I try to keep it is to invite my friends over to my house for traditional Saudi food 
on the weekend. The environment can lead to change only to the extent that it does not affect 
practices that reflect strongly-held cultural values.

Overall, food illustrates that while certain cultural expectations, such as gender roles and social 
rituals, form the foundation for individual food practices, individuals adjust these traditions in 
new surroundings. Some of these changes may only be temporary, especially if we think the 
traditional practice was really valuable and important. For example, I will be very happy to return 
to more social interaction during meals when I am back in Saudi Arabia. Other changes may lead 
to more permanent changes. For example, I’ve discovered I like to cook, so I plan to surprise my 
friends and family with this new skill when I go back to Saudi Arabia. Even though we may value 
the traditional practices of our families and culture, our desires and our environment do not 
always agree.  The way we react to new situations highlights the complex relationship between 
tradition, environment, and individual behaviors.

WRITING TO PERSUADE 
This chapter focuses on the type of writing used to persuade readers into changing their opinions about a controversial 
issue. As a college student in the United States, you will often have to employ this type of writing whenever your 
instructors require you to take a stand on an issue and support your position. Although this task may sound daunting, 
in this chapter we will show you that you have already been exposed to persuasive writing and informal context this 
experience may prove valuable to help you get started. Therefore, we will begin by considering less formal genres and 
topics where persuasive writing is also used from that familiar context we will move on to more formal issues. By the 
end of the chapter, you should be able to plan, draft, and revise your own academic persuasive essay.

Engaging in Discussions about Controversial Issues 
ALYS AVALOS-RIVERA 
People constantly engage in conversations about controversial issues in different contexts and media. You may have 
observed that sometimes people around you in favor of one point of view in everyday conversations or when they 
interact online. Some may use memes, others discuss hot topics through social media, and some even participate in 
online forums and blogs.  These sort of controversies may deal with real issues but can also address leisure topics. We 
will begin our exploration of persuasive writing considering a rather informal topic discussed in an online forum. 
The Controversy About Female Characters in Science Fiction 
Some people argue that women are usually misrepresented in fiction. This means that a great number of the main 
characters in novels, movies, and even in comics are men, whereas women are pushed into the background to play 
secondary roles. Just think of how many female superheroes you have heard or read about in your lifetime. Probably 
not many, especially if you compare the number of female leading characters with cool superpowers to their male 
counterparts. Right? The same happens with famous movies in the history of the film industry, particularly in certain 
genres, such as action and science fiction, which have usually been dominated by male figures. 
How many famous female leading characters from your favorite movies/video games/comics/animes can you name

the same amount of time. You can use the table below. Remember they should be leading characters, not supporting 
characters. For example, if you like the Harry Potter series, you cannot use Hermione Granger and your list,  because in

In the United States, the lack of female-centered stories has been taken into consideration by the movie industry to 
create a new generation of leading female characters in some movies such as Kill Bill, the Divergent series, and more 
recently, the new Star Wars trilogy.  However, some still believe that women are still far from being as well represented 
as men are. In the first part of this chapter, we will explore the end of the Star Wars series and see whether they feel 
that the situation has truly changed.

Women are not some extreme minority. That said, white women leads in science fantasy films franchises 
aren’t all that rare: the Hunger Game series, Resident Evil, Mad Max Fury Road, Lucy, Lara Croft, 
Underworld, Kill Bill, The Divergent series, Sucker Punch. 
I get Star Wars was hugely male-centered, but the people acting like a white woman lead in these kinds of 
movies is so groundbreaking haven’t REALLY been thirsty for a lead in this kind of film… They’re just getting 
to be commonplace. 
Ender_and_Bean 
It’s definitely been improving steadily ever since Ripley in Aliens (those others you’ve shared are all fairly 
new) and now the Star Wars universe can be added to that list. 
Mars 457 
Nine heroines in fourteen years is hardly commonplace. And none of those approached Star Wars in being 
any kind of cultural touchstone. Plus, many heroines are pretty poorly designed. For example: Zack Snyder’s 
idea of feminism is “girls dressed in sexy clothes and shoot things in their imaginary space, but in real life 
they just get abused and their agency robbed”. After Padme (whose death by childbirth lost me because I 
thought this was a technologically advanced society and not the Middle Ages, never mind that bull where 
she can’t muster up the will to live for her children) it’s certainly nice to have a Star Wars heroine who is 
allowed to take charge and not be damasked or otherwise lose her agency. 
 Lee_ 
That’s exactly what I was thinking. You can name a handful that are women, and several thousands that are 
men; that certainly doesn’t speak to equality or them being commonplace. I think Rey is a very significant 
character as a female. Speaking of equality, let’s bust out a definition, as the word “feminism” tends to so 
often invoke automatic reaction as if toward a resentful, man-hating she-beast. This is actually how the 
term is defined: Feminism- the advocacy of women’s rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic 
equality to men. 
Elegant Weapon 
Three of the top 20 films this year were all white women lead big budget science fantasy films. I’m not even 
including straight fantasy films from this year starring white women like Inside Out or Cinderella. By 
contrast, the only high grossing fantasy film released this year featuring a woman of color was Pixar’s 
Home. There were zero fantasy or sci fi films released this year that featured a man of color as THE lead, as 
far as I can tell. Forgot to mention, Star Wars: Rouge One next year will star a white woman.

The Thesis Statement in a Persuasive Text 
ALYS AVALOS-RIVERA 
In another chapter, we discussed the features of an informational essay. In this chapter, we will guide you to understand 
the essential elements of a similar type of academic text: the persuasive essay. Although informational and persuasive 
writing follow similar principles such as an orderly presentation of ideas that should be supported with evidence (e.g. 
facts, arguments, or examples), their purposes differ. The objective is written to take a stance (specific point of view) with 
respect to a controversial topic and persuade the audience to adopt the writer’s position. Because of this difference, 
the thesis statement of the persuasive essay needs to introduce the writer’s position in the controversy featured in the 
essay. Also, the preview of the essay’s structure should outline the arguments that the author will use to support his/
her stance. 
Should the US drinking age be lowered? 
In the US, drinking alcoholic beverages is illegal for people under 21 years of age (minimum legal drinking age or MLDA). 
This law has long caused a great deal of disagreement and debates. While some people think it is paradoxical that young 
people of 18 cannot enter a bar but still go to war, others believe that the law is the best way to keep youth away from 
irresponsible and heavy drinking episodes (also called binge drinking). The following texts were written by readers of 
the New York Times” Room for Debate page to express their opinions about the subject.
1 
• Read the comments and underline the readers’ main arguments (reasons to support one position or the other). 
• Identify which readers are against lowering the minimum drinking age (CON) and which are in favor (PRO)? 
• Which arguments seem the least convincing? Which are the most persuasive? Why?

The Thesis Statement in a Persuasive Text  |  43
Mason: 
Ever since the minimum drinking age was raised to 21 in 1986 the United States saw just as many if not more 
issues with irresponsible drinking as they did when the drinking age was 18. One of the major reasons for this is 
because kids are not learning how to drink responsibly before they can finally drink alone at age 21. If you look at 
areas that do not have a drinking age as high as the United States you will find that the amount of people that die 
due to alcoholic accidents in much lower than that of the US. For example, in China there is no drinking age and 
the rate per 100,000 people due to alcohol is .3% compared to the United States’  2.91%. I believe the main reason 
for this is because the Chinese can legally grow up drinking with their families and are able to learn how to drink 
responsibly due to the actions and teachings of their parents. 
Erick Ban: 
What makes me think people under 21 won’t be responsible? I could drink legally when I was 18, that’s what. I 
experienced and saw what happens when you give immature brains the right to pollute those brains. We 
shouldn’t be talking about lowering the drinking age because “If they can buy a gun, join the military and vote 
they should be able to drink,” we should be thinking about raising the age of those other things. After all, the 
brain doesn’t fully mature until around 25, right? All lowering the drinking age will do is raise the number of 
drunk drivers with the least experienced and most accident-prone demographic. 
Jonah S.: 
Turning 18 in the United States is the gateway to adulthood. When individuals turn 18, they can legally vote, get 
married and fight in our country’s military. However, one thing these “adults” still cannot do is purchase or drink 
alcohol. The age at which a person can legally purchase and consume alcohol has been an active discussion since 
1984 when the MLDA was raised from 18 to 21. The original reason the United States Legislation Act raised the 
MLDA was because there had been a rise in alcohol involved fatal motor vehicle accidents. The belief was that by 
raising the drinking age, there would be fewer accidents on the roads. However, research has shown that raising 
the drinking age did not solve the problem it was intended to solve. The number of fatal motor vehicle accidents 
has not gone down since the drinking age was changed from 18 to 21. In fact, this change in law just drove 
drinking underground and into unsafe environments. Nowadays, 3.2% of deaths in America are alcohol related 
which is higher than any other country. 
Robert Araujo: 
Have you ever heard about age of onset? Thombs and Osborn (2013) advocate that preventing or delaying the age 
of the first use of alcohol is the optimal way to reduce alcohol abuse and dependence in the future. Nobody is 
saying that alcohol must be forbidden, this is not the case. If they return the law to 18, adolescents may drink at 
16 years old. Now, they may drink at 18. Research has documented that the early you drink, the higher the risk 
you have to become addict: 14 years or younger you have 15.1% of chance to become addict, 15-17 you have 9.1% 
of chance, 18-20 you have 4.4% of chance, 21 or older you have 2.7%, In other words, we are preserving the 
future, the integrity of our youth, keep them away from addiction, as best as we can, Say NO to drinking at 18!!! 
Kevin Blake: 
All of the facts and figures in the world don’t matter to underage high school and college students that want to 
be cool and get wasted with their friends at the hottest party of the year. If you really want to lower the rates of 
underage consumption of alcohol and binge drinking, you need to make alcohol a mundane thing. A high drinking 
age is just prohibition at a targeted group, and everyone knows how well prohibition turned out. You’re not 
deterring anyone from drinking, you’re just making it a rebellious, fashionable thing to do. 
Evan 
Altenburg: 
I believe that the drinking age should remain at 21. I’m not naive, I know that kids under 21 drink and find ways to 
get alcohol. Lowering the legal age to 18 will simply make the process even easier for them to get it. Changing the 
drinking age to 18 isn’t going to affect kids 18-21. Those kids are in college, alcohol is everywhere and they have 
no trouble getting it. Changing the legal drinking age is going to affect 14-18 year old high school students. This 
model is clearly shown in colleges all around the country. Any freshman can walk onto a college campus and find 
alcohol almost instantaneously, because every junior and senior can buy it. If high school seniors can go buy 
alcohol than any underclassman can simply get alcohol from them. That’s how it works now. . .But instead of 
buying liquor from the 4-5 college dropouts who live around your area, now all you have to do is ask one of the 
800 seniors at your school. Seems a little too easy doesn’t it? If anything, change the age to 19 so that high school 
students can’t buy it. 
Content focus: Rating thesis statements 
Considering these features, in the following task you will analyze how six college students drafted their thesis 
statements for a persuasive essay on the MLDA controversy. In the prompt used by the instructor for this assignment, 
students were required to address the following purposes: 
• Present the PROs and CONs of the MLDA to a group of college students’ parents. 
• Persuade the parents to vote in favor of lowering the MLDA to 18 years of age. 
In other words, the writers need to take a stance on the issue. Read the Thesis Statement and assess how well each one 
fulfills the purposes given above and to what extent. Rate the Thesis Statement using a scale from 1 to 6, where 6 will 
44  |  The Thesis Statement in a Persuasive Text
stand for the best Thesis Statement and 1 will be given to the poorest. Be prepared to explain the reasons you have to 
support your rating. 
a. The United States has more accidents caused by drivers under the influence of alcohol than other countries where 
there is no MLDA (        ) 
b. Young people should be allowed to drink without legal restrictions based on their age, which is ridiculous (        ) 
c. Parents should teach their children how to drink alcohol in moderation.  (        ) 
d. Lowering the MLDA will allow parents to introduce their children to alcohol use under the supervision and reduce 
the rate of accidents caused by drunken drivers (        ) 
e. A reduction in the MLDA will help neutralize teenagers’ obsession with drinking, allow parents to monitor their 
children first encounters with alcohol, and reduce the rate of accidents caused by irresponsible drinking.   (        ) 
f. Having the MLDA fixed at 21 is only increasing young people’s fascination with drinking in unsafe environments and 
using false IDs.     (        ) 
Guidelines for a thesis statement 
What should be considered when drafting a thesis statement for an essay that aims to persuade the audience to take a 
stand in a controversial issue? Think of some possible guidelines to write an effective persuasive TS taking into account 
the following: 
• How should you address your audience? 
• Where in your text should you introduce your stance? 
• What language features (words, phrases) could be useful? 
• How can you connect your TS with the main arguments you will use in your essay? 
Write your guidelines below and discuss them with your colleagues and your instructor: 
The Thesis Statement in a Persuasive Text  |  45
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In some of the thesis statements listed above, the writers use modal verbs such as will and should. The first one (will) 
is used to predict the results that could be achieved if the authorities follow a specific course of action regarding the 
MLDA. The second one (should) is used to recommend what should be done with respect to the MLDA. These and other 
modal verbs that express advice, convey an obligation, or predict an outcome are often used to introduce the writer’s 
stance because they are useful to express the speaker’s desires, or his/her ideas of how the world should be. Other 
modal verbs that are also used with these purposes are: must, can, could, ought to, and also the semi-modal have to. 
When using modal verbs to compose your thesis statement, however, you should be careful to select the one that best 
represents your purpose. The meaning of your thesis statement can change a great deal if you use one or the other. Read 
the following examples and explain how the meaning has changed with each modal (in bold): 
 
Statement 
Meaning 
a. Authorities should lower the MLDA to avoid binge 
drinking. 
b. Authorities must lower the MLDA to avoid binge 
drinking. 
c. Authorities could lower the MLDA to avoid binge 
drinking. 
d. Authorities ought to* lower the MLDA to avoid 
binge drinking. 
 
*Although ought to and must are accepted as standard forms, they are not used in Academic English very often 
because they imply a strong and categorical position. Scientists usually abstain from categorical statements because these 
expressions do not convey that the writer remains open to new possibilities. Scientist prefer to maintain a more open 
attitude in their writing in case new evidence is discovered in the future that can change their points of view about the 
world. 
Although the participants in the Room for Debate’s and Star Wars pages hold different points of view regarding very 
different topics, they all engaged in their online discussions with a common purpose: persuading their audience of their 
point of view. They do so in a succinct fashion because their audience does not usually invest much time in reading blog 
posts that are too long and complex. Therefore, effective blog/forum posters try to be direct and present one single 
point per post. On the contrary, academic persuasive writing needs to be more detailed and provide the audience with 
more than just the author’s point of view. 
The Thesis Statement in a Persuasive Text  |  47
Organizing Your Arguments 
ALYS AVALOS-RIVERA 
The way the argumentation is presented in a persuasive essay is also special because writers do not only care about 
presenting their stance. They also want to include the point of view of their opponents to show that they have 
considered all possible angles of the controversy and have enough evidence to prove that the other side is wrong. 
Two Sides and One Controversy 
Taking into account the need to incorporate both sides of the controversy, observe the arguments presented in the 
Room for Debate page, which have been paraphrased for you below. If you were given the task to write a persuasive 
essay on the MLDA topic, how would you organize these arguments to compose three body paragraphs? 
PRO 
CON 
There are countries without legal drinking age; however, their 
rate of death caused by alcohol is significantly lower. This is 
because young people are able to learn how to use alcohol 
under the supervision of their parents since a young age 
Research shows that initiating alcohol consumption at a 
younger age increases the risk of becoming addicted to alcohol 
The number of accidents caused by individuals under the 
influence of alcohol has not been reduced since the US raised 
the MLDA. The law only forced young people to begin drinking 
in unsafe environments. 
People under 21 cannot be trusted to drink responsibly because 
their brains are not fully mature until the age of 25. Therefore, 
the MLDA should not be lowered. 
The MLDA only makes drinking look as a rebellious and cool 
thing to do. In order to reduce young people’s fascination with 
alcohol we need to turn drinking into a common practice. 
If the MLDA is lowered to 18, younger high school students will 
be able to access alcohol by associating with seniors they can 
easily meet at school.

Organization Templates 
Although the persuasive essay includes the two sides of a controversy, it does pay more attention to the position 
with which the writer is siding. The order in which the arguments are introduced is crucial to make the piece more 
persuasive. Traditionally, writers choose between three possible organization templates: 
Organizing Your Arguments  |  49
In organization template 1, writers present three of the arguments that support their point of view (PRO) and one 
that supports their opponents’ (CON). In the first body paragraph, the presentation of the opponents’ argument is 
immediately followed by a counterargument. This counterargument is an argument in favor of the authors’ point of 
view that directly addresses the opponents’ point and nullifies its persuasive power. Organization template 2 shows a 
variation of the same strategy that presents the counter argumentation on the third body paragraph. By contrast, in 
organization template 3, the argument/counterargument opposition is used along the three body paragraphs.

Legal Drinking Age: Twenty-One or Eighteen? Persuasion Time 
By Victoria DeCesare
1 
Alcoholic consumption began for many as a symbol of friends and acquaintances coming together to simply enjoy life 
1. Adapted and published with permission of the author 
50  |  Organizing Your Arguments
and “be merry.” However, in the United States, alcoholic consumption and the law have collided quite often in the past. 
The most recent and ongoing controversy regarding drinking is whether the legal drinking age should be lowered from 
twenty-one to eighteen. This is a huge controversy specifically relevant to college students, as drinking at American 
universities has grown to become a defining part of college life despite the fact that a majority of college students cannot 
even legally drink. It is clear through the prevalence and dangers of binge drinking among college students and the high 
percentage of DUI and alcohol-related accidents and deaths that something needs to change in this country. Lowering 
the drinking age from twenty-one to eighteen would be an effective and beneficial step in changing the binge-drinking 
culture in this country, encouraging drinking alcohol as a safe and enjoyable activity, and facilitating medical attention 
for those involved in alcohol-related accidents. 
First of all, lowering the drinking age to eighteen will eliminate the thrill of breaking the law for eighteen to twenty 
year olds. The idea of being rebellious and breaking the law while still having fun and not harming others in the process is 
an appealing and exciting idea for many underage college students. With drinking being illegal for those under twenty-
one and with the risk of “getting caught” always present and stimulating, drinking tends to become a more furtive act 
with it taking place in people’s dorm rooms, basements, etc. It is in these situations where drinking becomes the most 
dangerous, where pre-gaming, taking multiple shots in a row, and trying to get as drunk as quickly and efficiently as 
possible fosters binge drinking. If the drinking age was lowered to eighteen, there wouldn’t be that thrill to want what 
we can’t have because it would be legal. In traveling to England recently, where the legal drinking age is set at eighteen, 
I have observed how Americans visiting, studying, or living in England who are in the eighteen to twenty-year-old range 
treat drinking completely differently than the eighteen to twenty-year-olds here. In England, those Americans treated 
drinking as simply a normal social activity because it was legal and there wasn’t that thrill to break the law; in contrast, 
I only witness the binge drinking and “Get drunk” mentality, rarely, the mentality to drink in a relaxed and normal 
atmosphere for those under twenty-one range are going to drink regardless of if it’s legal or not. The difference lies in 
the fact that if it’s legal, there is no peer pressure or temptation to commit something illegal so less risky behaviors and 
treatment of alcohol will result. 
In the second place, because alcoholic consumption is considered an illegal activity for people until they reach age 
twenty-one, oftentimes teenagers are never really taught how to drink in moderation beforehand and therefore are 
more likely to abuse alcohol and binge drink. While the National Institute of Drug Abuse (2014) shows that drinking levels 
among younger people (and the American population in general), are decreasing, younger people are more likely to binge 
drink when they do consume alcohol (Kennet, 2008). However, I hold that binge drinking could be substantially lowered 
if the drinking age was lowered. This is because 18-20-year olds would then be able to experience moderate drinking in 
bars, restaurants, and other venues where there is supervision. Since this is currently illegal under the law, 18-20 year 
olds are now forced to drink in unsupervised venues were moderation is untaught and binge drinking is encouraged. 
In fact, having the drinking age set at the age of 21 has not stopped drinking among the 18-20-year-old age group, but 
has rather encouraged the movement of drinking to such unsupervised places were dangerous drinking behaviors are 
more likely to take place. The legal drinking age being set at 21 simply perpetuates the lack of a moderating culture 
in this country. Oftentimes, parents dismiss the idea that they need to educate their child on alcohol. With a lower 
drinking age, more parents would feel responsibility to introduce their children to alcohol in the controlled environment 
of the household beforehand as a means of education and instruct them on how to use alcohol in moderation. A Penn 
State research study (Abar & Turrisi, 2008) even showed a direct correlation between parents’ talking to their child 
about alcohol before entering college and subsequently lower rates of binge drinking. A lower drinking age would 
expose 18-20-year olds to a greater multitude of adults who can provide supervisory guidance over how to use alcohol 
moderately and therefore encourage less risky drinking behaviors. 
Many opponents to the lowering of the drinking age argue that it will result in more alcohol-related accidents and 
deaths, especially while driving. Drunk driving deaths have actually steadily decreased in the past thirty years. In fact, 
this trend began occurring since 1982, two years before the legal drinking age became twenty-one through the Uniform 
Drinking Age Act. It has shown that this trend occurred throughout all age groups and various other categories and 
therefore cannot be directly attributed to the drinking age. An estimated 90% of drunk driving deaths in the United 
States were found in the over 21 age group so drunk driving cannot be necessarily attributed to age (SAMHSA, 2010). 
Organizing Your Arguments  |  51
Furthermore, the same source reports that the amount of drunk driving deaths in the United States has decreased 
at a slower rate than that European of European countries that have their legal drinking age at eighteen or lower. As 
many people argue that lowering the drinking age is fatal, lowering the drinking age is actually going to save lives. 
This is because it will reduce the amount of people that become injured due to alcohol or that simply die because of 
alcohol poisoning who fail, or have others fail, to report their injuries to the police or the ambulance out of fear of legal 
consequences for underage drinking. Many states currently have laws that protect an underage person from the legal 
consequences of underage drinking if they go and seek medical attention; however, not many college students are aware 
of these laws and are still hesitant nevertheless out of fear that it may get back to their parents. Lowering the drinking 
age would encourage those in the 18-20-year-old range to seek medical attention for potentially fatal alcoholic injuries 
without fear of potential consequences for doing so, in turn saving the lives of many young adults, especially those in 
college. 
We are all aware of the drinking culture that takes place in this country. Particularly among college students, drinking 
has turned into a dangerous practice that is the result of the excitement of alcohol’s illegality for most college students 
and the fact that public officials and adults use drinking as a tool to punish and prevent a potentially enjoyable activity 
among an age group instead of encouraging the enjoyable and safe practice that drinking can be fore them. Lowering the 
drinking age, as exhibited around the world, can show how drinking can bring young adults and adults together in a fun, 
safe way instead of creating a disparity among them. If those young adults in the 18-20-year-old range share the adult 
same responsibilities that other adults do, then having the right to choose to drink should be no exception. It is time 
that alcoholic use, especially by college students, becomes a safe practice in this country instead of one whose culture 
lies concealed from sight and forced to grow uncontrollably and treacherously. It is time that eighteen, nineteen, and 
twenty year olds finally be trusted as the adults we are considered in every other way.

52  |  Organizing Your Arguments
Counterarguments 
ALYS AVALOS-RIVERA 
Using counterarguments appropriately is central to composing an effective persuasive piece. Remember that you should 
assume that your audience does not agree with you. Therefore, your goal is to make your readers change their mind by 
helping them see the matter from a different perspective. To accomplish this, you need to begin by acknowledging your 
audeince’s point of view and then address any weak point in their arguments. This is called “conceding and refuting.” It 
means that you first partially accept something your opponent says (concede), but then argue that your opponent’s view 
is not entirely true or accurate (refute). 
Examples of Counterarguments 
The following examples were taken from compositions written by international students who were requested to take 
a side in a controversy. Examples 1 and 2 discuss the pertinence of allowing college students use a new technological 
device called Google Glass in the classroom. Some people believe that this device will enhance students’ learning, while 
others fear that it will only distract students. If you want to know more about Google Glass, you can click on the 
link provided in Example 1. Example 3 focuses on the dangers of using nuclear energy and whether it could harm the 
environment or help to improve it. Read the examples carefully and use brackets to identify where the writers are 
conceding and where they are refuting their opponents’ arguments. 
 
Example 1 
Advocates of Google Glass think that it is a miraculous tool that can enhance students’ learning experience at school. 
They hold that the device will help students search information about many subjects during class and use class time 
more efficiently. For example, by using voice recognition technology and screenshots to take notes. Information can be 
easily registered and retrieved when needed. While this may be true, an excessive dependence on these tools can make 
students’ minds lose those thinking skills usually needed when taking notes in a traditionally way. 
-Khalid Alkhaldi 
 
Example 2 
Opponents of using Google Glass on campus claim that it can cause accidents because people would tend to be 
distracted while driving or riding their bikes. These concerns are understandable. However, plenty of accidents caused 
by distracted drivers are associated to the use of other devices such as smart phones or car navigation systems. In 
fact, the National Safety Council (2015) reports that one out of four car accidents in the United States is due to using 
cellphones while driving. In spite of this statistics, cell phone use is not consider an issue in our campus. Why should 
Google Glass be treated differently? 
-Mirai Nagasawa 
 
Example 3 
Scientists believe that nuclear power can solve the energy crisis once for all. Currently, nuclear-based power stations 
are already used in aircraft carriers and submarines. Moreover, the use of nuclear power can be environmentally friendly 
because it helps reduce fossil fuel consumption. Although there is some truth in these assumptions, they are based on 
one condition: that all these nuclear power stations never leak. Unfortunately, bad things always happen. In 1986, the 
Counterarguments  |  53
nuclear power station in Chernobyl exploded due to a failure in the cooling system. Thousands of people lost their lives 
and the environmental damage was appalling. 
-Pei Te 
 
Circle those words or phrases that the writers used in their pieces to: 
1. Introduce their opponents’ position 
2. Introduce the concession and the refutation 
Language focus: Phrases and Verbs 
Fill the following chart with the phrases/words that you circled in the text: 
Introducing the opponents’ view 
Concession and Refutation 
To present their opponents’ way of thinking the writers used the following verbs: think, hold, and claim. Which other 
verbs do you think could be useful for the same purpose? Write a list of at least 5 alternative options: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
Language Focus: Transitions 
To introduce the concession and the refutation, the writers of the examples given above used transitional words such 
as: although, however, and while. Observe how other writers used these words in the examples below and answer the 
following questions: 
• Where does the concession part appear? After or before the transitional word? 
• Where is the refutation placed? 
• How is punctuation used to separate concession from refutation? 
• Are while, however, and although used in the same way? If not, where does the difference reside? 
1. Some researchers have emphasized the importance of peer support in establishing good reading habits. While this 
support is beneficial, it is clearly not essential to sustain reading. 
2. It is true that those who enjoy numbers may be more able to take on billing challenges than others. However, 
medical billing involves more than comfort with numbers. 
3. The use of technology in the teaching and learning of reading has been highly praised. Although it is true that 
54  |  Counterarguments
technology does play a significant role  in creating artifacts, these activities did not preclude the students’ need to 
critically assess the texts they read in their digital world. 
4. Colleges and universities have been working hard to provide their students with wider online access. Although 
these efforts are commendable, they will undoubtedly result in an increase of tuition and fees. 
5. Reading interventions programs are often selected on the basis of their availability, familiarity, and ease. While this 
may seem like a practical approach, it is not always the best way to determine their suitability for students’ needs. 
6. Traditionally, the diversity of the learner is defined by ethnicity, economic conditions, and gender. These variables 
are undoubtedly useful to conform this definition: however, there are other issues of diversity that can affect 
learning and should be considered. For instance, variable such as visual or auditory abilities or the disposition of 
the learner should not be overlooked. 
 
With your colleagues, work out a rule to sue while, although, and however to concede and refute. To understand more 
about these transitional words you can refer to the Transitional Devices chapter. 
 
As a final exercise, you can go back to the essay by Victoria DeCesare and observe how she used concession and 
refutation in her piece. Identify in which sentences she used words such as while, however, and although. Do you think 
she used them effectively to present her counter argumentation? Why?

Writing a Persuasive Essay 
ALYS AVALOS-RIVERA 
Now that you are familiar with some of the most important aspects of the persuasive essay, it is time for you to begin 
planning your own paper. The topic of your piece will very likely depend on the guidelines provided by your instructor. 
Regardless of the topic, the following material will certainly be useful to help you plan, draft, and revise your work. 
Researching and Planning 
The topic of a persuasive essay should be a controversial one. This means that there should be at least two opposite 
points of view and that you take a stand in the controversy. Therefore, once you have decided on the controversy and 
your stance, you need to do some research to identify the different arguments that both sides use to defend their 
positions. To help you organizing this information you can used the following chart. An example has been made for you: 
Controversy: Do standardized tests contribute to students learning? 
Side 1 
The use of standardized tests fosters learning 
Side 2 
The use of standardized tests is against true learning. 
Arguments 
Arguments 
• Standardized tests are objective because they do not rely 
on teachers’ personal appraisal of students’ responses. 
• Standardize tests require the use of personal criteria to 
decide which contents are included and which are 
discarded. 
• Standardized tests promote fairness since they require all 
students prove that they have reached the same learning 
objectives. 
• The format and language used in standardized tests is 
familiar to students who have been raised in white 
middle and upper class families, but not to students of 
minority groups. 
• Standardized tests are useful to ensure that teachers and 
schools remain accountable to those who pay taxes to 
support public education. 
• An excessive emphasis on test results make teachers 
focus on a teach-to-test approach instead of keeping 
their efforts centered on students’ learning needs. 
 
You can use the following chart to list the arguments you found in your search:

Controversy 
 
Side 1 
 
Side 2 
 
 
Arguments 
Arguments 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Once you have a list of the arguments involved in the controversy you need to find the following: 
1. What evidence is there to support each one of the listed arguments? You will need to do some secondary research 
in the library databases to make sure you use reliable information. 
2. Which is the strongest argument of your opponents? 
3. Are there any weak points in this strong argument that you can use to refute your opponents’ view? 
Make a list of the facts and examples you can use in your argumentation and keep a careful record of the sources you 
will use to back up your claims. 
Outlining 
Once you identify your arguments and sources, it is time for you to plan the organization of your essay. There are writers 
who only think about the organization of a paper and begin to write following a mental plan. Others, however, prefer 
more structure. If you are among those in the second group, you may need to outline your essay. 
In order to write an outline for a persuasive essay, you should remember there are at least three different templates to 
use. You will also need to figure out the information you will use in your introduction and how you will relate your points 
to broader issues in the conclusion. You can use the outline structures provided on the following pages depending on 
the template of your choice.

Evaluating Your Work 
ALYS AVALOS-RIVERA 
Once you have outlined the main ideas you will use in your essay, you are ready to draft your first version. Remember 
that you need clear topic sentences and appropriate transitions in each paragraphs. In order to to revise your work (and 
that of your peers) you should check your instructor’s assignment guidelines and make sure your work addresses them 
to the best of your knowledge. As an alternative, you can use any of the following rubrics. 
 
Evaluation Sheet 1 
By Brianna Hook 
 
Instructions: This worksheet can be used during peer review sessions. You may write on this paper and on the 
author’s essay. After reading and critiquing your peer’s essay, return your responses to the author. Alternatively, you may 
use this sheet to revise your own work. 
 
1. Read the entire essay. Underline the thesis statement in the introductory paragraph. Has the author taken a clear 
stance on the issue? Are the main points clearly written, logical, and in parallel form? 
2. Are the author’s ideas organized in an effective manner? Did s/he follow the same order as the points were 
mentioned in the thesis statement? 
3. Look back over the essay. Describe any point(s) where you were confused, unconvinced, or uncertain of the 
connections or ideas being explained and expressed. You may suggest transitions or recommend clarification of 
ideas. (You may also circle those in the essay.) 
4. Find three places where you think the author could add more specific information, explanation, or evidence. 
Suggest specifically what kind of additions could be made (for example, facts, quotes, or statistics). 
5. Look at the author’s use of outside sources. Has s/he effectively integrated the sources into the essay? Does the 
information from sources clearly support his/her arguments/ideas? Has s/he properly used in-text citation to 
give credit to the sources? 
6. If the author only had an hour to make changes, what top three things should s/he do? 
7. Now look at grammatical and sentence-level issues (including verb tenses, subject-verb agreement, use of 
prepositions, word choice, spelling, commas, etc.) and mark these clearly for the writer to see. 
8. Lastly, do you think the author makes an overall convincing argument? Could you be persuaded to his/her side? 
Why or why not? Be specific in your critique. 
 
Evaluation Sheet 2 
• This rubric helps you assess your essay considering five categories:content, organization, documentation style,

EMAIL GUIDELINES 
Communicating across cultures is challenging. Each culture has set rules that its members are unaware of because, 
cultural norms and values are not taught explicitly, most of the information is absorbed subconsciously. 
With the advancement of technology in our world, Intercultural communication has become widely spread via email 
communication. Be it an academic or professional contacts, email is one of the primary means of communication. Email 
does not involve face-to-face interaction with the potential audience, however, it does not mean that it should be 
considered less formal. 
International students often worry about how to address an email message to a professor – especially one whom they 
do not know or they have not met in person. In this chapter, we will discuss some concerns students need to keep in 
mind when composing an email to their instructors or professors. 
Email Guidelines  |  69
70  |  Email Guidelines
What to Consider When Writing an Email to a 
Professor? 
MIRIAM KINFE 
Subject Header Should Be Informative 
You are composing an email for a reason. To inform the recipient/professor about your main reason for writing the 
email, write the purpose of your message. This is not a salutation line, therefore clearly state the main concern the email 
intends to address. For example: “Request to enroll in your class”. 
Salutation 
Make a polite and formal salutation that sounds good to the ears and looks great to the eyes. Do not write ‘Hi 
professor’ or ‘Hey there’. Instead, address your professor politely and professionally including title and last name. For 
example: ‘Dear Professor Jones,’ (followed by a comma), ‘Professor Jones’ are polite and professional ways of addressing 
a professor. 
Do Not Use Smiley Faces or Other Emoji, Internet Acronyms and 
Abbreviations 
Email style is not the same as text message style. All Electronic shorthand signals such as LOL, U for “you”, smiley faces 
and emojis such as 😀 😁🤔 should be avoided. 
Avoid Silly Mistakes 
Spell correctly and write grammatically correct messages. Show that you care about how you present yourself and 
writing to your professor. 
Paragraph Breaks 
If you have more than one concern, use paragraph breaks to help organize your message. It is hard and boring to read a 
long paragraph addressing a lot of concerns. Paragraph breaks make your message clearer and easier to read. 
What to Consider When Writing an Email to a Professor?  |  71
Appropriate Closing 
Once you compose your email and are ready to send it, make sure you use appropriate closure to your message. The 
most appropriate ways are ‘Sincerely’, ‘Regards’, ‘Best Regards’ followed by a comma. 
Sender’s Information 
If it is your first time to email your professor, clearly identify yourself at the beginning of your email by saying: ‘My 
name is Betty Steve, an undergraduate student in your International Composition class’… etc. At the beginning of your 
message, right underneath your salutation, write your name. 
Another thing that you need to consider is to make your name appear as the sender of an email rather than your email 
address or username. This means that the recipient of the email knows that the message is from Betty Steve instead of 
‘beti_steve12@okstate.edu’.

Examples and Exercises 
MIRIAM KINFE 
Example 1: Inappropriate Student Email 
Subject: [none]1 
Hello Mam,2 
I Adya, student of Composition on wednesday3 group at 5pm.4 I have tried a lot to submit assignment on 
drop box.5 But still i6 am unable to do so. Would you please help me?.7 When i click on drop box there ‘no 
folder found’ is displayed. I am worried about it. 
Thank you8 
The example above emphasizes an example of an inappropriately composed email sent to an instructor. Some problems 
with the email are: 
 
1. There is no subject as to why the sender is composing to email. 
2. Mam is in an appropriate salutation to a professor in an American context. 
3. Then, the sender introduced herself, which is good. But, she had some technical problems with capitalization 
(Wednesday-3, 1-6) and space after period (4,5,6,7). 
4. The main content of the message has some grammar errors and was not proofread before it was sent. 
5. The sender did not close her message appropriately (8). 
Example 2: Inappropriate Student Email 
Subject: [none]1 
Dear Mam2, 
I submit the student information. 
Hurray 🙂3 
Examples and Exercises  |  73
The second example is a continuation of the first one. Subject line is missing, salutation is informal and closing is 
inappropriate, as the sender use smiley and informal language. 
Example 3: Appropriate and Formal Email 
Subject: Problem Submitting Assignment 1 
 
Dear Dr. Martin, 
 
My name is Adiya Kumar, a student in your Composition II class. I was unable to post my assignment on 
D2L. Would it be possible if I come to your office today, at 2 pm in the afternoon? 
 
Also, I have some questions related to our class project. Do we choose our team members or will you 
assign us? 
 
Thank you. 
Sincerely, 
Adiya Kumar 
In the example above, the sender had a clear subject title that addresses her reason to compose the email. Then, she 
saluted her professor professionally. Next, she introduced herself, and clearly mentioned her main concern. She used a 
paragraph break to address another concern related to the class. At last, she concluded her email by a formal salutation 
and signature (full name). 
Exercises 
1. Write an email to your professor. 
2. Write an email to a friend. 
3. What differences have you noticed?

Cultural Context 
MIRIAM KINFE 
Addressing a Recipient 
Languages and cultures have different ways of addressing people. In Russian culture, it is essential that a plural form 
of ‘you’ is used to refer/address someone who is older or in a senior position than the writer. In Chinese culture, 
addressing someone by their professional or courtesy name conveys respect as Chinese prefer to be addressed formally. 
In Chinese, usually the title follows the family name. Chinese women use their maiden names even after marriage, 
therefore marital status might be indicated using Mrs., Ms., Miss, or Madam could be used, but in modern times it is 
used rarely. In some other cultures, first names are commonly used instead of last names or family names. In such 
situations, people’s profession is followed by their first names. The salutations ‘Dear Respected Sir/Madam’ are very 
common in Indian English. This is considered old-fashioned and native speakers of English do not use ‘respected’ in 
their salutations. 
In American context, when addressing a professor use the recipients professional title and last name. For example, 
assume that you are writing an email to a professor whose name is Ben Jones. The proper salutation is: Dear Dr. Jones 
or Dear Professor Jones and not Dr. Ben. 
Message 
Another cultural difference that occurs in email communication is the content of the message the email contains. In 
some African, Arab and Asian cultures, the message is not clearly specified and it is left to be understood through 
context, nonverbal cues, and through interpretation of what is actually said in the message. In contrast, English-
speaking countries expect messages to be explicit and specific.

USING OUTSIDE MATERIAL AND AVOIDING 
PLAGIARISM 
Learning objectives: 
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to: 
• Understand the value of incorporating someone else’s sources into your own writing. 
• Be more confident about incorporating someone else’s sources into your own writing. 
• Be able to distinguish the differences among the following three strategies summarizing, paraphrasing, and 
quoting. 
• Decide when to use each strategy appropriately in different situations. 
• Interpret and create basic citations in several common formats 
• Determine the difference between plagiarism of ideas and plagiarism of words 
• Use the strategies above to successfully use outside material while avoiding plagiarism 
 
Using Outside Material and Avoiding Plagiarism  |  77
78  |  Using Outside Material and Avoiding Plagiarism
Avoiding Plagiarism 
HO'OMANA NATHAN HORTON AND YELIN ZHAO 
In every part of culture, But especially in the academic world, plagiarism (the unauthorized or uncredited use of 
someone else’s ideas or words) is a very serious offense, and can result in devastating career and social consequences. 
Simply Googling the phrase “plagiarism scandal” will reveal many cases of individuals (including U.S. vice presidents) 
who were caught plagiarizing, sometimes in relatively minor ways, and suffered serious consequences. 
Plagiarism is wrong and is taken so seriously because it can be considered both dishonesty and theft. When you use 
someone else’s ideas or words in your work and do not provide credit, you are essentially claiming that those ideas and 
words were written by you. Therefore, you are lying about the source of the words, & receiving credit for another’s work. 
Plagiarism of Ideas 
Plagiarism of ideas is the use of another’s ideas without providing credit. Determining what counts is plagiarism of 
ideas can be very tricky, especially when riding in another culture. In many ways, plagiarism of ideas can be more 
dangerous than plagiarism of words, because it is less straightforward and is easier to do accidentally. This typically 
occurs for two reasons. 
• Students believe that information is common knowledge and does not need to be cited. 
◦ What can be considered ‘common knowledge’ varies widely based on your audience. As we have mentioned 
throughout this textbook, understanding your audience is absolutely essential to writing successfully and 
avoiding plagiarism. 
◦ To use the example earlier, the fact that the United States of America was founded in 1776 is generally known 
by many Americans (and probably others around the world). However, in an article written for American 
history experts, this information is clearly general knowledge and does not need citing. On the other hand, in 
an article written in the field of soil sciences, this may be much less likely known, and may need citation, 
especially because the reason for giving this information may be found in a specific text (e.g. a law regarding 
farms was passed when America was founded). 
◦ In addition to the problem of determining what is common knowledge, I have seen many students provide 
facts and information which may be commonly known and accepted, but it is simply untrue. For example, one 
student mentioned that Arabic contains Millions more words than English, which is simply not true (in fact, 
English may have more words in Arabic). This is a commonly-held belief, especially among Arabic speakers, 
and while the student’s claimed did not count as plagiarism, the fact that no credit was given indicated that 
the claim may not be based on reality, and also caused the instructor to believe the student had given 
someone else’s information as their own. 
• Students read an outside source, learn something from it, then give this information without citation. 
◦ Reading is often an essential part of writing, especially academically, and we can strengthen our arguments by 
supporting them with the works of others. However, it is always necessary to give credit for someone else’s 
ideas, even if you read them briefly. When you learned information which supports your argument, you must 
give credit to the author for this information. 
Considering the consequences of plagiarism, it is much better to be safe when you are unsure about what is common 
knowledge, and find a reliable source, then cite their information. 
Avoiding Plagiarism  |  79
Plagiarism of Words 
Plagiarism of words is more straightforward. This involves using words or information (no matter how small the 
amount) from someone else’s work without providing credit. There are many softwares such as (turnitin.com) which can 
search the entire internet and compare students work with other published works and report similarities. Remember 
that is not wrong to use outside sources, and doing so is actually very important too much academic writing. However, 
it is essential that credit is given when any information is taken from outside sources. 
• Note that anytime you paraphrase or quote directly, you must provide a page number for the location of the 
original words in the text, both to give credit, and to direct readers to that information if they want to find it for 
themselves.

HO'OMANA NATHAN HORTON AND YELIN ZHAO 
Why We Use Outside Material 
Before we discuss in detail three strategies to incorporate someone else’s work into your own writing summarizing, 
paraphrasing, and quoting, it is of great importance to first talk about why we need to use other writers work. There are 
several important reasons: 
• First of all, at the institutional level, as a student, there’s a great possibility that you will be asked to write a topic, 
perhaps a new topic that is unfamiliar to you. In this case, you need to first read the work of others and then 
demonstrate your understanding of others work accurately. 
• Second, at a broader level, as an academic writing is a community event, incorporating others’ work is a great way 
to Showcase your knowledge, add credibility to your writing, and show your membership as part of a discourse 
community. 
Strategies for Using Outside Material 
Now we have a general idea of the importance of using others’ ideas. Let us proceed to discussing what summarizing, 
paraphrasing, and quoting mean: 
• Summarizing means using your own words to present the main ideas shown in an original source (a book an 
article etc). 
• Paraphrasing involves using your own words to present a specific part/segment from source material. 
• Quoting means the segment of the source must be identical to source material, word for word. Notice that this is 
one of the major differences that distinguish quoting from summarizing and paraphrasing. 
 
Important tips: 
All of the above presented strategies require you to attribute ideas (i.e. summaries, paraphrases, and quotes) to the 
original source. Generally speaking, among the cases in which plagiarism is involved, the most frequent types are not 
citing the original Source when summarizing or paraphrasing because you might think that there is no need to do so 
considering you use your own words. However, as long as you have borrowed the ideas (excluding common knowledge), 
you need to give credit to the author who originally proposed the idea. 
Now you know the definition of differences between summarizing, paraphrasing, and quoting. You might have 
wondered when to use each strategy. Additionally, you might have wondered whether you can use quotations most 
often, since it is the easiest job to do. Notice that of these three strategies, quoting is rarely used, for several reasons. 
When you use direct quotation, you have given up the opportunity to use your own words to display your 
Using Outside Material  |  81
understanding of the original text for your own purposes. It also signifies the readers that you are highlighting a 
particular word, phrase, sentence, or passage and trying to distance yourself from the original text as the words are 
not your own. To use direct quotations effectively, you need to make sure that it is your intention that the quotation 
serves the above presented functions. Using quotations due to its simplicity rarely leads to success. When you practice 
summarizing, typically you should be objective by simply presenting the main ideas in the original text. In contrast, 
paraphrasing allows for your own comment on the original source. 
Giving Credit for Outside Material 
Anytime that you use any outside material, it is essential that you give credit for this information. Failure to give credit 
for either ideas or information which are taken from outside sources is plagiarism, and is a very, very serious offense, 
even if committed on accident. 
In my experience as an Academic Integrity facilitator, I have encountered many honest students who did not mean to 
deceive instructors or intentionally claim that outside information was their own, they simply weren’t aware of how or 
when to give credit for outside material. As a rule, you must always cite any ideas or words that you get from outside 
sources,  no matter how small they may be. Well this line can sometimes be blurry (for example, do you need to cite a 
source to support the fact that America was founded in 1776, or is it general knowledge?). Keep in mind that it is always 
safer to cite the information when you aren’t sure. 
We know that it is essential to give credit, but how do we do this in academic writing? There’s a very specific way 
to give credit in academic writing which we call citing your sources. In almost every form of academic writing this will 
consist of two parts, both of which are necessary. Before we describe these parts in detail, it may help to see a short 
example of a properly cite a direct quotation. This example uses APA format. Various formats and citation methods will 
be discussed in more detail below. 
• A reference citation. This provides full bibliographic information in a specific format (defined by your discipline or 
instructor). These will typically appear on a separate References or Works Cited page at the end of your writing. 
Reference citations serves two purposes: 
◦  Gives full credit to the author of the work. 
◦  Gives your reader the necessary information to find the original work for themselves. 
•  An in-text, or parenthetical citation. This is a brief version of the reference citation (typically containing just the 
author’s name and the year of the work) which appears right next to the portion of outside material you use, 
whether you summarize, paraphrase, or quote directly. Like the reference citation, this portion also serves two 
purposes: 
82  |  Using Outside Material
◦ Indicates to your reader that the ideas or words are from an outside source. 
◦ Gives you a reader a link to the full information in the reference citation so that they can find the information 
for themselves. 
▪  Take a look at this Wikipedia article about William Labov.  Look at the first paragraph. Try clicking on 
some of the small numbers in brackets at the end of the sentences. Where does the hyperlink read? 
•  In-text citations can appear in several different ways, which are typically called author-prominent and 
information-prominent. Take a look at the above examples, and think about the differences between the two. 
Why might an author choose one over the other? What are the advantages in each example above? 
◦ Author-prominent citations give the author’s name in the text. This type of citation is typically used for one or 
more of several reasons: 
▪  The author is well-known (this is probably the case in the example above, since William Labov is a very 
famous linguist). If the author is famous in the field, mentioning their name first gives credibility. 
▪  The text is addressing the author’s work as opposed to only the ideas or words used from outside. 
▪  It fits more appropriately with the structure of the sentence. This is usually a stylistic choice, and as you 
can see above, both sentences are grammatically appropriate. 
◦ Information-prominent citations give the cited material first, followed by the reference information.  In 
contrast to author-prominent citations, these usually indicate a focus on the side of the information. This is 
typically done when the author is irrelevant to (or less relevant than) the information being cited. 
▪  Given this information, do you think that it is an appropriate method for the example given above? 
Different Methods of Citation 
There are many different methods of formatting documents and given credit for outside information. These are typically 
called styles, and while many disciplines and scholarly journals have their own styles of citation, we will describe several 
styles which are frequently used and which you may be required to use during your academic career: APA, MLA, and 
Chicago. 
Remember that there are different reasons for using outside materials. These reasons can vary by discipline, author, 
and context. Each of the styles we will describe here gives credit and slightly different ways for different reasons. There 
are extensive official guides online which describe the mechanics of citing information in each of these styles which 
will be given below, so we will only discuss the major differences in the citation styles and some of the possible reasons 
behind these differences. 
Before we go any further, take a look at the in-text citation and reference citation for each of the three styles below 
and try to answer the following questions 
• What does each of the styles focus on in the citations that the other styles do not? 
•  What do the styles all have in common? 
•  What information is given in full, and what information is abbreviated in each of the styles?

84  |  Using Outside Material
APA (American Psychological Association) 
APA style is primarily used in the social and behavioral sciences (e.g. psychology, sociology, Linguistics, etc.). You may 
have noticed that unlike MLA style, the in-text citation used in APA includes the year that the book was published. 
By showing the years of the work you are citing, you allow the reader to follow the chronological development of the 
research you cite, and can also show your reader how recent (or historically important) the research you are citing is. 
Notice that in the reference citation, the author’s first name is not given, only the initial. This is likely because most 
disciplines would choose this style are more concerned with the research and its findings than with the author of the 
study. In contrast, both MLA and Chicago style give the author’s full name. Notice also that the year is the second piece 
of information given, all the other two styles list it last. 
 
MLA (Modern Language Association) 
MLA style is predominantly used in the humanities (e.g. art, literature, music, etc.). You may have noticed that the in-
text citation for MLA does not include the year of the work. Instead, it includes only the author’s last name and the page 
number. As mentioned above in the description of APA, notice that the reference citation for MLA gives the full name of 
the author. This is likely because works in the humanities (e.g. art, literature, music) are often more concerned with the 
author and his/her work than when the work was published. 
 
Chicago/Turabian 
Chicago style is primarily designed for history and art history, but a variation of Chicago called Turabian style was 
designed specifically for student research writing, and is used in many disciplines and courses, from business to 
mathematics. This style is very flexible, so we recommend consulting your instructor for specifics about how you should 
say to using Chicago/Turabian Style. 
In contrast APA and MLA style, Chicago and Turabian use footnotes, meaning that information about the work is 
given in a footnote or endnote rather than in the text. This helps make your writing simpler and less interrupted by 
bibliographic information. Credit is still given to the author, and your reader can still find the information that she/he 
needs to find the source for themselves, but the style takes the focus off of the site of information and focuses on your 
own writing.

Evaluating an Internet Source 
ALYS AVALOS-RIVERA 
Having internet access opens the door to an incredible amount of information that can be a great help when you’re doing 
your homework. However, there are so many options from what you can choose, being selective is essential. Otherwise, 
you can invest a lot of time just reading, listening to, or watching available sources without getting your assignments 
done. Moreover, you should also consider the possibility that some of the information you can find on the internet is not 
totally reliable, appropriate for the audience, or relevant. Therefore, the challenge is to generate some well thought-out 
guidelines for identifying a source, before you decide to use it for your assignment. The purpose of this lesson to tell 
people about these guidelines. 
Interrogating a source 
As a first exercise, take some time to observe the following reference entry. Before clicking the link spend some time 
observing the details provided in the entry to answer the following questions. 
• What information about the source can you get from this entry? 
• What type of source are you dealing with? How do you know that? 
• What are the details can you get from the entry? 
Source 1 
McInerney, L. (2016, February 28). Golden handcuffs for teachers won’t 
solve the staffing crisis in our schools. The Guardian. Retrieved from: 
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/28/should-
teachers-trained-in-our-system-stay-in-our-schools 
 
 
Now click on the link and try to find out if your guesses were accurate. 
Observe the information provided on the web page and answer the following question 
• What  Is/are the names of the authors? 
• What is the name of the organization/company/group the insured information? 
• When was this information published/posted? 
• What do all these pieces of information tell you about the source? 
• Would it matter to you if any of these pieces of information were not provided? Why? 
As you can see, the article comes from a newspaper. To know more about the information you can find on the different 
sections of a newspaper, click on this link. 
The student has been given the following prompts to guide her as she writes her final papers for three different 
structures. Read the prompts carefully and decide whether the article from the Guardian (Source 1) would be a good 
source for any of the assignments. Does this article meet the student information needs as the writer of these three 
papers? State the reasons for your answer. 
1. Write a descriptive essay in which you report the different opinions, good or bad, held by the general public 
Evaluating an Internet Source  |  89
about public vs private education. This should be based on the results of a survey that you will conduct in your 
neighborhood. The survey will collect people’s opinions about private and public education with respect to the 
following topics student learning outcomes, quality and availability of learning materials, local schools 
facilities, the quality of teaching, and tuition costs and fees if any. 
2. Write a persuasive piece in which you argue that the teaching profession in the U.S. is undergoing a severe 
crisis. You must include at least three reasons why teachers present situation to be considered as a crisis. You 
will have to support each of your argument with evidence e.g. statistics, experts opinions, scientific reports. 
3. Summarize at least three different scholarly articles to address the problem of the shortage of teachers in 
England. Make sure you clearly state the purpose of each study, the method used, and the results obtained in 
each case. Take into account that you’ll have to present your summaries to a committee of professors in your 
department who are experts on the topic. 
Discuss two reasons with your classmates and your instructor. Compare your answers and opinions about this exercise 
with their ideas for writing on a public page 
Relevance, reliability, and appropriateness. 
Relevance 
The prompts in the previous section and Source 1 have overlapping ideas with regard to topics and subtopics, but also 
differ in certain aspects. To find out if it is a good idea to use a source from the same as described in the prompts you 
should consider the similarities and differences. Let us analyze each case separately. 
Prompt A and the newspaper’s article have something in common: they both address the topic of education. The 
article talks about the problem of public school teachers’ salaries and one aspect included in the prompt also talks about 
teachers’ work, in particular the quality of their work. The similarities between the article and the prompt end there. 
There are differences between the articles and the prompt that should be considered. 
• The assignment prompt clearly states that the content of the paper should be based on a survey previously 
conducted by the student. The results of the survey will provide “first-hand” information that the author (in 
this case the student) is supposed to collect directly from her neighbors. For this reason, this type of 
information is considered as a primary source. On the contrary, the article provides information that the 
newspaper’s writer has taken from various sources. She used this information to prove her point. This is why 
this sort of document is considered as a secondary source. Thus, the newspaper article is not the right type of 
source that the assignment prompt requires 
• The assignment requires information about the quality of public and private education. The article only talks 
about teachers’ low salaries. It does not address the other topics required in the prompt such as learning 
materials, school facilities, or tuition costs. Therefore, the information in the newspaper article does not fully 
address the contents listed in the prompt. 
 
The content of the article and the type of information it provides do not address the prompt. Therefore, it could be 
said that this particular source does not meet the writer’s information needs. In such cases, you can say that, although 
the article may be interesting and it is published in a well-reputed newspaper, the source is not relevant for the purpose 
90  |  Evaluating an Internet Source
of this particular assignment. A relevant source should address your information needs as a writer considering the 
content and type of the source that best fits your writing purpose. 
 
Exercise 1 
Consider how relevant Source 1 would be to address Prompts b and c. Compare your evaluation with your colleagues 
and your instructor. 
Reliability 
Let us revisit Prompt b and compare it with information available on Source 1: 
b. Write a persuasive piece in which you argue that the teaching profession in the US is undergoing a severe 
crisis. You must include at least three reasons why teachers’ present situation should be considered as a crisis. 
You will have to support each of your arguments with evidence (e.g. statistics, experts’ opinions, scientific 
reports). 
Remember that Source 1 talks about the shortage of teachers associated to the low salaries offered in most teaching 
positions. Considering that the assignment’s purpose is to argue that the teaching profession is in crisis, you can say 
that Source 1 is relevant for the assignment at hand. However, when you are preparing an assignment, relevance is not 
the only characteristic you should take into account. You also need to consider the sources’ reliability. 
Reliability refers to the extent to which the text represents reality. When a text is reliable, you can depend on its being 
truthful, objective, and free from bias (personal tendencies or preferences). In other words, a reliable text should be 
consistent with the world it tries to represent. A reliable source is supposed to represent reality as faithfully as possible 
by offering facts, evidence, and logical reasoning, as opposed to mere opinions. 
A typical obstacle to hinder the reliability of a source is the writers’ bias. This means that writers may sometimes mix 
their personal opinions in the presentation of the facts, which makes us wonder whether one can truly trust in what 
they say. 
Ideally, we all want information that we can fully depend on or rely on. Unfortunately, sometimes the information we 
find on the internet may contain claims that are biased. We should take this type of information with caution, especially 
if you are going to use the information in your assignments. This takes us back to consider whether Source 1 can be 
considered reliable. 
You may remember that the article comes from a British newspaper called The Guardian. At this point you may ask 
yourself if The Guardian is a well-regarded newspaper and, most importantly, you may ask if newspaper in general can 
be taken as reliable sources. The answer to these questions is not straightforward. It may greatly depend on the type 
of newspaper, the reputation of the particular publication, the section of the newspaper where a particular article is 
published, and the editorial line of the newspaper. To know more about newspapers and how they are classified, click 
on the following links:types of newspapers and objectivity. 
As a rule of thumb, before deciding on using a newspaper article in your assignments, remember that newspapers, no 
matter how well-reputed they are, may have a political slant (preference or inclination) and most of them are oriented 
towards profit (after all, newspapers are there for the business). This means that you should always keep in mind that 
newspaper column writers do not provide “facts” for the sole sake of providing facts. They may be favoring a particular 
point of view which colors their writing. Therefore, whether the newspaper is owned by a private company or by the 
government, a conflict of interest is often at play in the presentation of the news. For this reason, always ask yourself: 
• What is the political slant of this source? 
• Whose interest are the writers favoring in this article? 
• What evidence is presented to prove the writers’ claims? 
Evaluating an Internet Source  |  91
Coming back to Source 1, you should know that The Guardian is a newspaper that has a liberal slant but a good 
reputation because of its efforts to be as objective as possible. This means that, although the articles published in this 
publication tend to support the left wing, they usually offer some evidence to support their claims. However, remember 
that Prompt b requires you to write a persuasive essay, which means that you have to offer a balanced argumentation. 
Using only an article from a leftwing newspaper as your source will not suffice. You need to get other points of view and 
put them into conversation to make a well-balanced argument. In conclusion, Source 1 is only partially reliable for the 
writing purpose at hand. 
The same considerations that we have discussed about newspapers also apply to all sort of news you can find on the 
internet such as those on TV networks websites, radio station websites, and online magazines websites, among others. 
An interesting example to consider is the one of Wikipedia. To find out more about the degree of reliability of this famous 
open-access encyclopedia, click on the following link. 
A couple of ideas that can help you in your search of reliable material are the following: 
a) Whether the creator of the source is an expert or professional in that specific field 
b) Whether the source is reviewed by peer professionals in the same field before it was published. 
Exercise 2 
Look at the following two sources and rate their degree of reliability in a scale from 0 to 10, where 10 means highly 
reliable and 0 means not reliable at all. [Hint: Where they are from gives hints.]

Appropriateness 
Saying that a source is appropriate may imply two different things: 
i) The source affords information that a particular audience may be inclined to accept and find as credible. For 
instance, scientists have preference for information that is supported by data and use specialized terminology to 
express complex concepts. On the other hand, personal experience and touching stories will be more appealing 
to the general audience. 
ii) The source successfully achieves a specific purpose with the audience. For instance, a source may 
successfully persuade the readers but fail to entertain them. 
In any case, the question of whether a source is appropriate or not is related to the audience you have in mind when you 
92  |  Evaluating an Internet Source
write. Effective writers always think of their audience at every step of the writing process. This means that when you 
select your sources you also need to consider your audience. Who are your potential readers? Do you want to inform 
these readers, persuade them of your point of view, or tell a story to make a point? You need to answer these questions 
when you are selecting your sources. 
Let us now consider whether Source 1 is appropriate for Prompt c: 
c. Summarize at least three different scholarly articles that address the problem of the shortage of teachers in 
England. Make sure you clearly state the purpose of each study, the method used, and the results obtained in 
each case. Take into account that you will have to present your summaries to a committee of professors in your 
Department who are experts on the topic. 
This writing assignment expects students to summarize three scholarly articles (meaning they are written by a group 
of specialists in the corresponding academic field). First of all, The Guardian is not a scholarly journal (to know what sort 
of publication scholarly journals are, you can follow this link). So, even though the topic discussed in Source 1 is related 
to that of the prompt (this means that the source is relevant), Source 1 is not the type of source required by the prompt. 
Why is this so? 
First of all, your audience is a group of professors in your department, who are experts in the field. As such, this 
audience expects highly reliable material, usually written by experts in their same field. That is the reason why the 
prompt specifically asks you to use only scholarly journal articles. 
Second, your purpose or goal is to summarize the articles for this group of experts. The scholarly articles you use as 
sources should feature primary research and your summary should succinctly incorporate the purpose, the method, 
and the results of these studies. Newspapers like the Guardian can only provide facts and opinions from experts and 
researchers, but such articles never describe research studies in detail. This is because newspaper articles do not target 
a group of specialists as their main audience and their purpose is not to popularize research results. 
Therefore, for a source to be appropriate, it should contain information that may be consideredacceptable for the 
standards of youraudience and contributes to the purpose of your writing piece. 
Exercise 3 
With a group of two or more colleagues, consider the following two sources:

Source 2 is about the relationship between teacher mobility and salary change. It is from a peer-reviewed journal. Source 
5 is about the imbalance between teachers’ efforts in work and their low pay. It is from a trade journal Education Week. 
With this information in mind, do the following two tasks. 
a. At first sight, make a guess about which one is more reliable than the other.

Activity 5 
How is Source 8 (Pullen, 2007) different from other sources that you have evaluated in this lesson? What type of 
document is this one? Look at the screen shot directly taken from Proquest Research Library database on the following 
page. Look at the list of source types on the left column. Discuss the different types with your classmates and your 
instructor: 
Go to the end of this lesson and read the text “Things you should know about the different types of sources that 
you can find in ProQuest database”. Based on this information, discuss the different degrees of relevance, reliability, 
and appropriateness of the sources available in the library. Consider also some internet sources such as blogs and the 
Wikipedia. How reliable are these sources? Why? 
Evaluating an Internet Source  |  97
Questions you should ask to assess a source 
Questions you should ask 
Why should you ask this? 
1. Who is the author of this text? 
1. A reliable source should clearly state who (person or 
organization) is responsible for the claims made in the text. 
2. What is the author(s)’ background? 
2. Is/are the author(s) of this text experts on the topic? What 
authority do they have to make claims on this topic? 
3. When was this text published? 
3. Knowing the date will allow you to say if the information is 
recent or outdated. 
4. What organization do/does the author(s) belong to? 
4. If the organization that issues the document is a serious 
and respected/reputable one for the specific topic, such as a 
scientific journal, or a well-known university, you may feel 
more inclined to trust in the source. 
5. Was the document submitted to a peer-review process? 
5. Some documents are first submitted to a group of experts 
before they are actually published online. Such is the case of 
scientific journals, which makes these publications more 
reliable. 
6. Is there any possible conflict of interest? 
6. If the document presents evidence that supports the 
commercial interest of the organization that issues the 
document, you may feel inclined to question the claims made 
in the text. For instance, for decades cigarette companies 
claimed that nicotine did not cause cancer and published 
some documents to support their claims. Now we know that 
they were in the wrong but kept supporting the idea because 
of their commercial interest.

Newspapers as a Source: Types, Sections, and 
Objectivity 
ALYS AVALOS-RIVERA 
A newspaper is a publication that is periodically published (daily or weekly) that presents news and informative articles. 
In the past, newspapers were only published on paper, usually of the cheapest quality possible to make them affordable 
to the public and profitable for the publisher as well. Nowadays you can still find newspapers in their traditional form 
(paper based) or online. 
Types of newspapers 
Newspapers can be classified in different ways depending on their format, the type of news they cover, and their 
periodicity. One classification scheme divides this type of publications into two large groups: broadsheets and tabloids. 
Initially this classification was only based on the size of the pages. A tabloid is usually half the size of a broadsheet. 
However, with time, tabloids became associated with sensationalist news that present biased (or sometimes even false) 
information written in a style meant to scandalize happenings so as to catch readers’ attention. In contrast, broadsheets 
are usually considered as serious publications that strive to present news in an objective manner. 
A second classification scheme is based on the coverage of the news published in the newspaper. Although most 
newspapers would usually contain news of the most relevant international and national events, some newspapers have a 
special focus on either regional or local news. For this reason, these types of newspaper are only sold in a specific town 
or region. On the other hand, national newspapers cover news of national and international interest and are sold all over 
a country. The last classification deals with how often the newspaper is published, which could be daily, three times or 
twice a week (biweekly or triweekly), once a week (weekly), or even once a month (monthly). Those newspapers that are 
published on a monthly or weekly basis sometimes focus on specialized news such as sports, arts, business, or news of 
local interest [click here to go back to reliability]. 
Newspaper sections 
The article “Golden handcuffs for teachers won’t solve the staffing crisis in our schools” was published in The Guardian, 
a well-respected British newspaper. Follow the hotlink provided in the reference entry to visit the article’s webpage. 
Once you are there, pay attention to the following details: 
• On the left of the article’s title, you will notice a couple of subtitles. One of them says “Teachers Shortage” 
(orange fonts). The second title simply says “Opinion” (gray fonts). 
• If you follow these links, you will notice that the first subtitle gives you access to other articles on the same 
topic which were published in the previous months. 
• The “Opinion” link takes you to the section of the same name. What does the word “opinion” mean in this 
context? 
• How does the information in the “Opinion” section (also called “Editorial” section in other newspapers) differ 
from the information provided in other sections? 
Newspapers as a Source: Types, Sections, and Objectivity  |  99
 
In the past, when newspapers were actually just made out of paper, they all had different sections that readers could 
actually differentiate because they were placed on different pages. These sections were used to present the information 
classified in categories so that busy readers could only focus on those news they really cared about. For instance, if a 
reader only wanted to read the sports news, s/he could simply search for the sport page and ignore other sections such 
as entertainment or classified advertisements. Nowadays, if you want to search for a particular section on an online 
newspaper you have to look at the hotlinks. These links are usually on a ribbon or link menu placed on one of the margins 
of the webpage (usually the top or the left margin on Western newspapers). 
Knowing the nature of the information that each newspaper section affords is of great importance to evaluate a 
source taken from a newspaper. The section of “Opinion” on The Guardian’s webpage, for example, is devoted to articles 
that express the writers’ opinions on a given subject, usually a controversial issue. This means that the journalists do 
not claim being objective or impartial when they write these pieces. On the contrary, the authors freely present their 
political views or make value judgement of the situations/events being discussed, which is not usually done in other 
types of journalism. This does not mean that in the “Opinion” section writers do not present evidence to support their 
claims. They sometimes but not always do! In most of them, the author(s) voice their point of view and weakly support 
that without providing adequate evidence. 
Furthermore, some of these pieces are not confident enough to bring up alternative viewpoints for the audience 
to have a complete picture and then decide which side to believe. These types of articles are trying to persuade the 
audience to adopt a particular point of view. By contrast, other sections may have a very different focus. For instance, 
the “World news” section may only focus on presenting facts while the “Fashion” section may afford more visual material 
to describe or promote a new trend. To sum up, be cautious before you decide to cite the content in the “Opinion” 
section of the source. 
As an exercise, you can visit a different online newspaper and browse the news provided on each section. Ask yourself 
the following questions: 
• What is the purpose of this piece? To inform? To persuade? To narrate a real story? To sell a product/service? 
To give advice? 
• Does/do the author(s) claim something about a specific topic? If yes, how do they support their claims? With 
logic/facts/statistics/emotional appeals/visual evidence/experts’ opinions? [Click here to go back to 
Evaluating an Internet Source] 
Objectivity 
It was mentioned before that broadsheets usually publish news that are written in an objective manner. This means that 
the writers do their best to represent the facts as close to the reality as possible, without involving their feelings or 
opinions in the report. If you consider that writers are human beings with feelings and opinions, and that newspapers 
are a business whose first objective is to make profits, being objective becomes a complex matter. For this reason, we 
cannot talk about a piece of news that is absolutely objective and a newspaper that is 100% free from bias. In fact, 
newspapers usually take a particular political stance (position) that somehow determines how the news, especially 
the editorial or opinion sections, are presented. Some newspapers are said to have a left, center, or right tendency, 
depending on the type of political views they hold or political parties they favor. A newspaper’s political stance also 
determines its audience. This means that, for example, a conservative audience would usually favor a conservative type 
of newspaper. 
As a reader, it is important to be aware of the newspaper’s stance and consider it whenever you read your news. A 
good principle is not to get your news from a single source. This practice will allow you to see the different points of 
views about a particular event and decide for yourself, instead of simply following other’s opinions. This is especially 
100  |  Newspapers as a Source: Types, Sections, and Objectivity
important if you are considering using newspaper articles as part of your sources for an assignment. Moreover, you 
should keep this principle in mind when browsing news on other sources different from newspapers, such as TV, radio 
broadcasts, or online sources such as Google News, or Yahoo News. They all follow a stance and address an audience 
with a political point of view [Click here to go back to reliability] 
As an exercise, you can observe the following statements about the problem of global warming taken from the 
websites of two famous TV Networks (You can also click on the hotlinks to read the whole articles). Consider the 
following questions: 
• If you only read the headlines on the Fox News article, what is the idea that you get about the causes of global 
warming? 
• Is that the same idea that you get once you read the content of the article (pay attention to the words that were 
bolded for your reading convenience)? 
•  According to the CNN News website, what is causing global warning? 
• Do these two articles agree on the causes of global warming? Why is that? 
Early man’s actions caused global warming, study says (Fox 
News) 
A new analysis of ice-core climate data, archaeological 
evidence and ancient pollen samples is being used to suggest 
farming some 7,000 years ago helped put the brakes on a 
natural cooling process of the global climate, possibly 
contributing to the warmer climate seen today. 
Your climate change questions answered (CNN News) 
Nine in 10 of the scientists said global temperatures are rising 
and 82% said this rise is because of human activities such as 
burning fossil fuels and putting more heat-trapping gases in 
the atmosphere. 
To find out more about the editorial line (political stance) of these two sources (Fox News and CNN News) and the 
political views of their audiences you may check the following article from Business Insider. However, remember that 
this is again a source may also have a political stance and may be not absolutely reliable.

The Case of Wikipedia 
ALYS AVALOS-RIVERA 
The first and foremost criteria for checking the reliability of a source can include the following: a) whether the creator 
of the source is an expert or professional in that specific field; b) whether the source is reviewed by peer professionals 
in the same field before it was published. 
A practical example for using these criteria is the use of Wikipedia. The reliability of the information published on 
the Wikipedia varies a great deal. The main reason is that Wikipedia is a web resource collaboratively constructed by 
writers with various levels of credential and expertise. Both experts and novice can contribute to a topic. What’s worse, 
any addition or modification is published even before the designated administering team can oversee the content. If a 
lie appears in Wikipedia, the content will be available on line for a while before the administrators can spot it. There are 
several anecdotes of this sort of incidents with the Wikipedia. In one of them, a student made up a “famous” quote for a 
Wikipedia page about the life and works of a famous composer. The student issued it right after the composer died. The 
spreading rate was so fast that the quote had been cited at a huge amount before the administrators could eliminate 
the false quote. Details of this story can be found at this news website: http://www.nbcnews.com/id/30699302/
ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets/t/student-hoaxes-worlds-media-wikipedia/#.VtoCS8D2ZMs or you 
can google this article “Student hoaxes world’s media on Wikipedia”. 
In spite of this and other similar cases, the public is still inclined to trust the information in Wikipedia. In fact, many 
people who are not familiar with one topic will first look something up in Wikipedia. Is this totally wrong? Well, not 
entirely. Wikipedia sources can be useful when one is not familiar with a certain topic and wants to find out some 
general introductory information about it. It can be a very nice ice-breaker between the information seekers and the 
topic. However, its function will end here. If you are planning on writing a scholarly piece of writing or even a paper 
for a college-level course, you should look for more reliable sources than Wikipedia. Always look for materials that have 
been subjected to editorial scrutiny before being published. This means that someone else, who are usually colleagues 
or professionals in the same field, had a close examination on the document before it was published or uploaded. The 
most reliable sources are usually those that were reviewed by a group of experts on the subject. Therefore, to produce 
a reliable piece of writing, such as a course paper or a journal article, one had better start from some scholarly journal 
articles which have been subjected to a process called peer-reviewing. You can learn more about this process in the 
following link. 
[Click here to go back to reliability] 
102  |  The Case of Wikipedia
Sources in a ProQuest Database 
ALYS AVALOS-RIVERA 
Scholarly Journals 
The articles that you can find in a scholarly journal may be research reports, essays, or book reviews. These texts 
are usually written by experts and addressed to experts in the same field (e.g. scientists and university professors). 
Therefore the language may be highly specialized or technical. Some scholarly journals are regarded as highly reliable 
sources not only because they are written by experts, but because their content is submitted to a peer-review process. 
This means that a group of experts in the field read the article before it is authorized to be published in the journal. In 
this process, the peer-reviewers provide pertinent feedback so that the author(s) can make any necessary changes to 
ensure the quality of the publication. If you want to make sure that your search in ProQuest renders only peer-reviewed 
journals, you need to check the corresponding box before you click on search (see picture below). All scholarly journals 
always provide detailed references at the end of the article so that the readers will be able to locate the sources used by 
the author and read these sources directly if they desire to do so [click here to go back to appropriate]. 
Trade Journals 
A trade journal is usually addressed to practitioners in a given profession. For this reason, the topics in this sort of 
publications are usually related to practical matters within a specific type of work or occupation. You will not find state 
of the art research reports in this type of journal. Moreover, some trade journals are peer-reviewed by experts, but 
that is not the norm. In most cases, the articles only go under the scrutiny of an editor. This means that someone who 
works for the journal, usually a professional writer, helps the author refine details such as grammar, spelling, and other 
formatting details before the article is published. Trade journal articles sometimes provide lists of references, but these 
lists tend to be rather short. 
Magazines 
Magazines can vary in topic but the contents are usually addressed to a non-professional/non-expert type of audience. 
Therefore, the articles are not too specialized and may only be of interest to those who do not know much about a 
specific topic. A magazine article is usually edited, but not peer-reviewed. In some cases, magazine articles may present 
more in-depth information about a topic as opposed to a newspaper article. Usually, magazine articles can be longer and 
the authors have more time to work on their articles. As for their sources, magazine articles may only mention the name 
of the person who provided the information, or say that a certain fact was proved by a recent study. However, the details 
of the sources used are not always provided. Finally, you should also remember that just as there are different types 
Sources in a ProQuest Database  |  103
of newspapers, there are also different types of magazines written for different audiences and with diverse degrees of 
reliability and levels of specialization. 
Newspapers 
Newspaper articles may be written by journalists who are not experts on a topic but have the necessary skills to do 
some secondary research on the topic and report the information they find. Since newspaper writers are pressed by 
time to publish on a daily or weekly basis, they have less time to refine their work and verify their claims than magazine 
writers. Additionally, as in the case of magazine writers, newspaper writers do not always provide clear references for 
their sources. In the best cases, the writers of online newspaper articles provide hotlinks to their references, but that is 
not always the case. [Click here to go back to Evaluating an Internet Source]

Introduction 
HO'OMANA NATHAN HORTON AND PAUL SIMS 
Throughout your academic career, it is very likely that you will be asked to write a summary. This is related to, but 
more extensive than, the summarizing discussed in the last chapter about how to incorporate outside material. Much 
like the summarizing described in the last chapter, a summary provides a shorter version of a text. However, while 
summarizing a text to support your own writing is typically only a few sentences, a summary is a standalone document 
which gives the reader a brief version of the original text. This may seem simple, but the way that you write a summary 
of a text depends on the purpose for writing the summary. In the following chapter, we will discuss the following 
elements of writing a successful summary: 
● Reading and understanding texts 
● The purpose of writing summaries 
● The different types of summaries 
● The moves of writing summaries 
● Avoiding plagiarism when writing summaries 
Introduction  |  109
Reading and Understanding Texts 
HO'OMANA NATHAN HORTON AND PAUL SIMS 
2.1 Reading the text and getting started 
When writing a summary, one very common tendency is to focus too much on only one or two points or details of the 
text and fail to provide the reader with an overall view of the entire text. It may help to think of a summary as a 
shrunken version of the original text. To help visualize this, imagine that the source text is a t-shirt with a pattern 
covering the entire shirt. If you want to make the shirt smaller but still show the pattern, you cannot simply cut off the 
sleeves or the bottom half of the shirt and put them together. You must shrink the entire shirt and keep everything the 
way that you found it. As you write your summary, keep this image in mind, and as you revise, make sure that you can 
see the overall image of the original text. 
As mentioned above, one important purpose of a summary is to help you understand the text, and in some cases, show 
others that you understand the text. Therefore, it is essential that you read the text thoroughly at least twice in order to 
develop a basic understanding of the ideas. Below are some tips for reading a text which you will be summarizing: 
• Annotate as you read. It is extremely helpful when reading to annotate the text (highlight, underline, make 
notes). These notes will help you to understand the text as you read it again, and will also help you keep track of 
important ideas. 
• Find the thesis. Remember that in your own writing, there is an underlying thesis, the main point (or points) of 
the text, which holds everything together, and all of the details and support in the text should point to and 
support this thesis. The same is true of most writing that you will read, so finding the thesis first will be greatly 
helpful as you attempt to understand and summarize the text. 
• Pay close attention to headings and subheadings. Most academic articles (and even many news articles, 
especially online) have headings and subheadings. These will help you to understand the material, but will also 
help you when determining how you will organize your summary and which details you will include. As you 
read, pay attention to the headings and subheadings and consider how each section contributes to the overall 
thesis of the text. 
2.2 Strategies for successful reading 
Although the tips above may help you understand how to read and understand a text generally, readers often get stuck 
at the paragraph or sentence level. Sometimes you may have difficulty understanding new terminology. If you’re reading 
something from a new, unfamiliar discipline, you may have a hard time understanding a text without having background 
information. Sometimes, you may just get bored while reading. Below, we offer some specific strategies to help you stay 
on track while reading and understand texts at the sentence, paragraph, and whole-text level. If you’re having trouble 
reading, stop, take a deep breath, and try some of the strategies below to get a better grasp on what the author is trying 
to express. 
• Skimming: Quickly look through the headings and subheadings: See if you can figure out what the author is 
trying to say; in other words, what his or her point is. Look for words related to headings and subheadings in 
the text. 
• Framing: Read the first sentence of a paragraph, then go the bottom of the paragraph. Ask yourself: Are you 
110  |  Reading and Understanding Texts
having difficulty understanding how the author got to the final sentence? If so, go back through the paragraph 
and read the rest of it, looking for the same or similar words from the initial and last sentences. 
• Scanning: If you are looking for a particular word, identify that word and search the printed text using your 
index finger, or with digital text, by scrolling and looking for it with your eyes. 
• Referencing: Keep a dictionary on hand, especially when you are reading what you find to be a difficult text or it 
is in a discipline that is unfamiliar to you. Your dictionary can either be digital or print. 
Reading and Understanding Texts  |  111
The Purpose of Summaries 
HO'OMANA NATHAN HORTON AND PAUL SIMS 
When a writer sees “summary” as part of his or her instructions on how to write something, this can fill the writer with 
dread. The writer’s mind might begin to seem backlogged with questions, such as What is a summary?, Why do I need to 
do this?, What if I leave out something important?, and What if I plagiarize and don’t even realize it? 
With the appropriate level of understanding and preparation, a writer needing to develop a summary can be better 
able to face such a task with greater confidence and skill. 
What are some reasons why someone might want to summarize something? 
• Improve understanding (current self). When you summarize something, you are engaging a thought process 
which grants you the opportunity to internalize the subject undergoing summary and produce a work which 
helps you put the concepts into a shape which you can more readily comprehend because you did the work to 
make sense of it. 
• Create a concise version for future reference (future self). Especially when conducting research on a topic, you 
might not be able to keep every resource you need on hand at all times. An example of something like this is an 
annotated bibliography. Also, you may want to keep a record of sorts of the kinds of resources you’ll need for 
different research topics and directions. A summary for future reference can help you at some future point 
when you need to analyze a source for usefulness. 
• Show someone or some number of other people that you understand (others). There are times when you will 
need to demonstrate your ability to comprehend and communicate others’ ideas, such as in a complex research 
paper or when showing an instructor what you learned from different readings. How will each of these 
audiences affect the way that you write your summary? Audience is a paramount consideration in how one 
chooses to approach the development of a piece of writing. So, how do you go about dealing with the different 
audiences within these reasons we’ve mentioned: current self, future self, and others? 
112  |  The Purpose of Summaries
Types of Summary 
HO'OMANA NATHAN HORTON AND PAUL SIMS 
There are two primary types of summary: Descriptive and evaluative. As with many types of writing, not all summaries 
will fit perfectly into one of these categories, but these descriptions can help you know where to start when writing a 
summary. 
• Descriptive: A descriptive summary is very much rooted in expressing facts. It focuses on the essence of the 
item under review, sharing the main point and any important, supporting details. The writer’s opinion is rarely 
found in a descriptive summary. It is a concise description of the work, which means the writer uses as a few 
words as possible to convey the essential elements of the item being summarized. 
• Evaluative: Just like the word “evaluative” suggests, this type of summary requires the writer to evaluate the 
item being summarized. This classification of summary is opinion-heavy. While a few basic facts about the 
piece are required, such as the author and the title and the main point of the piece, the remainder consists of 
the summary writer’s viewpoints of the work. The author will detail his or her perception of the work in such 
areas as intended audience and purpose and how well these are addressed in the work. The person evaluating 
the item will also look at how this item will be useful to him or her and examine where it falls short. Because 
the types and frequency of examination found in the evaluative summary may involve extensive explanation, it 
will very likely be longer than the typical descriptive summary. 
4.1 When are these used? 
• Descriptive: A writer uses a descriptive summary when he or she wants to gain and express an understanding 
of what the author said in the original text. 
• Evaluative: A writer will choose this summary type when he or she wants to examine the original text for 
usefulness, validity, strength of argument, or other important elements. 
4.2 Connecting audience and purpose 
• More often than not, descriptive summaries will be used with two of the three intended audiences mentioned 
above – current self and others. The descriptive summary will help a writer process the main and supporting 
ideas in the works. 
• However, an evaluative summary could address current self, future self, and others, depending on why you 
might be writing the summary. If you are trying to work on a project in at a given moment which requires 
source analysis, then an evaluative summary might be the best way to go. When considering your future self 
and how to write a summary, an evaluative summary written early on may help you save time when you are in 
the middle of finishing a project later. And, if you are making a recommendation to others as to whether they 
should use the source, an evaluative summary might be your best choice.

As you become familiar with how to write summaries and how to think about audience, you will likely be better able 
to make such decisions by yourself. Note that both types of summaries will be in the summary writer’s own words as 
much as possible to avoid the suggestion of plagiarism, which we will discuss later in this chapter.

The Moves of Writing Summaries 
HO'OMANA NATHAN HORTON AND PAUL SIMS 
Now that we have discussed the two basic types of summary (descriptive and evaluative) and some possible reasons you 
might use either one, we will give a few practical tips for writing summaries, including how to organize your summary, 
which details you should include from the original text, and a few grammar points that can be tricky. 
5.1 Organization 
The organization of a summary will almost always follow the overall organization of the original text. Remember that 
in a descriptive summary, your goal is to convey the same information as the original text in a more concise manner. 
However, there may be some exceptions to this, especially when writing evaluative summaries. While it is still essential 
to express the main points of the text, you may want to highlight some strengths or flaws in the text through your 
organization. 
5.2 Including details 
One of the most common difficulties students have when writing summaries is deciding which details and information 
to include. A summary, whether descriptive or evaluative, should portray the overall meaning of the text (remember 
our metaphor about shrinking a t-shirt), but it can be difficult to balance showing the full picture with providing 
unnecessary details. Here are a few tips for deciding which details to include: 
• Include one or two examples at most for each main idea presented in the body of your summary. Remember 
that in a descriptive summary especially, your objective is to give a general idea of what the text was about, so 
avoid including too many details. When writing an evaluative summary, it may be appropriate to give more 
details or examples when examining one particular idea in the text. 
• When writing, and especially when revising, consider whether the examples or details that you include are 
necessary to explain or support the main ideas of the text. Will your reader be able to understand the thesis 
and main points of the text without the detail or example? 
• Unless you are providing specific details (numbers, important quotes, etc.), express details and examples in 
your own words by paraphrasing. Many writers fall into the trap of simply copying and pasting information 
from the original text. Even if the quotation is properly cited (we’ll discuss how to do this more below), too 
many direct quotations cause the summary to simply be a patchwork of the original text rather than a concise 
summary in your own words which still shows the overall image and main point of the text. 
5.3 Language moves 
There are a few important grammatical features that are common to summaries which may seem minor or unimportant, 
but can actually have a significant effect on the meaning of your writing. 
The Moves of Writing Summaries  |  115
Let’s begin by reading the following very brief summary. Focus especially on the verbs, how and when they are used, 
and their tense. Take notes of the things you notice. 
In the essay “Making the Grade,” Kurt Weisenfeld, a professor of Physics at Georgia Tech University, 
argues that there has been a discernible decline in his students’ work ethic over the last generation. Based 
on his own personal interactions with his students, he observed that many of his students failed to see the 
connection between their final grades and their own personal hard work (or lack thereof). Rather, they 
seemed to feel they are simply entitled to the grades they want. Weisenfeld theorizes that their indifference 
towards learning is the result of a society saturated with superficial values and the “erosion of quality 
control” for grades in the public education system (e.g. giving out grades that were not really earned). 
Because most of his students are science and engineering majors, he fears that their poor work ethic and 
“hyperrational thinking” could potentially result in costly or harmful engineering accidents. 
There are two prominent features in this summary which are important for any summary: 
1. The author uses verbs that indicate they are summarizing. For example, “Kurt Weisenfeld […] argues that,” 
“Weisenfeld theorizes that,” and “he fears that.” Generally, when you write a summary, your reader (whether a professor, 
a colleague, or yourself) will know that you are summarizing from another text. However, it is still important to indicate 
that you are summarizing because it helps you to ensure that you are summarizing the author’s ideas rather than your 
own. This is essential when writing an evaluative summary because you must keep the author’s ideas and your evaluation 
of those ideas separate. 
2. The author primarily uses present tense (“argues”, “theorizes”, “fears”), but also uses the past tense (“observed”). 
Why do you think the author selects these tenses? What difference would it make if the author said “Weisenfeld 
theorized that…” in line 5? The use of tense when talking about someone else’s work or writing is a challenge for almost 
all academic writers, regardless of how long they have been writing, and unfortunately there are no hard and fast rules 
as to which tense should be used when. However, there are some general principles which can help you decide which 
tense to use: 
a. Generally, the present tense is used to describe an idea or argument which an author put forth in the text. It helps 
to think of a text as the author talking to you. Although the author finished writing this idea down at some point in the 
past, they are still presently making this statement or argument through the text. An exception to this would be if you 
know for a fact that the author has since renounced their idea, or no longer believes it. 
b. Generally, the past tense is used to describe an event or action that occurs in the text. For example, this is 
commonly used to talk about the methodology or events that the author used to reach their conclusions or support 
their 
arguments. 
c. It is important to note that the use of tense can also indicate the writer’s stance on the idea reported. If the writer 
uses present tense, he or she is not questioning the idea, but accepting it as still valid. If the writer uses past tense, he 
or she often will go on to show that the idea is no longer valid or that the writer disagrees with it.

Avoiding Plagiarism when Writing Summaries 
HO'OMANA NATHAN HORTON AND PAUL SIMS 
Because a summary is a restatement of someone else’s work, it can be very easy to plagiarize unintentionally. In the 
section below, we’ll discuss places where it can be especially easy to plagiarize unintentionally, some tips to avoid 
plagiarism when summarizing, and when we need to cite in a summary. 
6.1 When could plagiarism occur in a summary? 
Because you are summarizing what someone else has written, it can be easy to commit the plagiarism of words that 
we discussed in the previous chapter, especially when it comes to describing the details and specifics of an author’s 
argument or support for that argument. Many writers may incorrectly believe that because the reader typically knows 
that a summary is taken from someone else’s text, it is unnecessary to quote or cite words that are directly taken. 
However, just like with any other use of outside material, you must always give credit for directly copied words. In 
addition, the use of verbs which indicate that you are summarizing from another text will help you to keep your retelling 
of the author’s ideas separate from your own interpretation or evaluation of those ideas, especially in an evaluative 
summary. Although the previous chapter gives great detail about how to cite from outside sources, we will review how 
and when to do this in a summary below. 
6.2 When do we need to cite in a summary? 
You will recall from the previous chapter that there are two different types of citations: Full reference citations, and 
in-text citations, both of which are important and used when writing any type of summary. It will help to recall the 
reasons that we cite at all. First, to give credit to someone else for their work and second, to help our reader find the 
cited information. Both types of citation perform both of these functions in a summary: 
• Again, even though your reader will likely be aware that this is a summary of another text and not necessarily 
your original ideas, you must include a full reference citation either before or after the summary, depending on 
your preference or your instructor’s requirement. Some instructors prefer that the reference citation be at the 
top of the page before the text, and some prefer that it be on a references page at the end. Either way, the 
inclusion of a reference citation acknowledges that you are describing someone else’s work and gives your 
reader the ability to find the source easily. When you write a summary for your own research purposes, this 
can help you create a sort of catalogue so that you can easily go back and find the original source if you need to. 
• In-text citations are mandatory after any direct quotation from the text, or after specific details and 
information (e.g. numbers, dates, etc.), even if they are not directly quoted. Citing this information directly first 
helps to separate the author’s direct words from your description of their ideas. It also provides your reader 
with the ability to easily go back and find the information in the article themselves.

Exercises and Resources 
HO'OMANA NATHAN HORTON AND PAUL SIMS 
Using about 250 words, reflect on your reading of this chapter and your participation in the above exercises. First, 
summarize the main points of this chapter. Then, consider and write down what new information you learned. Also, 
think through and document how this chapter reinforced your previous understanding of summary writing. Finally, 
consider contexts in which you might need to write a summary. What types of information will you need to include for 
these audiences. Describe how confident you are in your ability to write a summary now. If you think you need to do or 
learn something else to gain more confidence, what do you think this is and how do you plan to go about doing it?

TRANSITIONAL DEVICES 
In this chapter we analyze the use of two transitional expressions that are frequently used in academic writing: however 
and although. Transitional expressions/signals are important coherence devices that guide your readers to understand 
the logic between your ideas. For example, transitional expressions such as also, and, and in addition can help the 
readers understand your intention to share an additional idea; transitional devices such as in summary, in conclusion, 
and finally can signify the readers that you are concluding your previously stated ideas. It is very likely that you already 
understand the meaning of these words. However, you may sometimes hesitate when using them in your writing. 
Therefore, we expect that a closer observation of the examples provided here will help you improve the way you use 
transitions in your writing.

Activity 1 
1.1. The following passages use the word however to connect ideas and express a specific purpose. Read the passages 
and try to differentiate appropriate and inappropriate uses of however. Discuss with your peers why however has been 
used inappropriately in each example. 
1. Department of Education noted that state and local officials should have the flexibility to determine 
appropriate content for a student’s summary, which must be based on the student’s individual needs and post 
secondary goals. However, this flexibility must be balanced with the need to assure that students with 
disabilities, upon leaving high school, have a comprehensive summary of performance (SOP) that promotes self-
determination. 
2. One of the greatest advantages of using technology at schools is that students can communicate with people all 
over the world. However, in contrast there are also some disadvantages. 
3. After I finished my first year of college, I decided to move off campus and I saw many differences between living 
on and off campus. However, there are many differences between living on and off campus that can impact on 
students’ health, academic performance, and personal comfort. 
4. Brazil’s average per capita income had fallen from a peak of 25 percent of the U.S. average in the 1960s to just 16 
percent by the late 1990s. In the last decade, however, that number began to climb, and it has now risen to 
roughly 20 percent. 
5. Nowadays most teachers can optimize instruction by using technology in their classes instead of just talking or 
using the chalkboard. However, digital devices such as the smartphone have become an essential tool for 
students. 
6. It cannot be established with any certainty what happened to the Titanic during its descent to the seabed. 
However, what is now known is that once the ship disappeared below the ocean’s surface, it broke into three 
pieces. 
7. Nowadays, students spend a great deal of money on textbooks, however, the idea of replacing textbooks with 
tablets may be a solution to reduce the cost of education. 
8. There are many differences between English and Korean, such as their alphabets, grammatical structure, and 
the use of honorifics. However, it is clear that Korean is harder to learn than English because of its alphabet, 
grammar, and the use of honorifics. 
9. 25 Male participants’ favorite brand of cigarettes remained stable across the 5 telephone surveys (2003-2008); 
however, female participants’ favorite brand changed dramatically after the Camel No. 9 advertising campaign. 
10. Teachers, students, and tutors responded that some student materials could be clearer; however, overall the 
clarity of those materials was acceptable. 
1.2. List the passages in which however has been accurately and appropriately used (You can simply write the numbers 
of each passage). 
Numbers: ____________________________________________ 
1.3. In the following chart list the problematic cases and write down a brief explanation about each problem.

Passage Number 
Possible Reasons 
Based on an analysis of 100 student essays, we found that however, the transitional expression is often misused. 
Therefore, the goal of the following activities is two-fold. First, it aims to raise your awareness of when and how however 
should be used appropriately in academic writing. Second, these activities challenge you to practice the use of however 
as a contrastive transitional device. 
Activity 2 
Read the following sentences in which however has been used appropriately and follow the instructions given below: 
1) Sentences 1-5 emphasize one main theme. Identify this theme and circle it. 
2) Sentences 6-10 emphasize two themes. Identify and circle them. 
3) In all of the sentences, two features are in contrast. Identify and underline these features. 
4) Work out a rule as to when however should be used. 
Example: The United Arab Emirates’ rapid modernization has brought remarkable advancements in public health. 
However, modernization also has brought new risks (e.g. an increment in non-infectious conditions such as cancer). 
1. Brazil’s average per capita income had fallen from a peak of 25 percent of the U.S. average in the 1960s to just 16 
percent by the late 1990s. However, in the last decade, Brazil’s average per capita income began to climb, and it 
has now risen to roughly 20 percent. 
2. Department of Education noted that state and local officials should have the flexibility to determine 
appropriate content for a student’s summary, which must be based on the student’s individual needs and

postsecondary goals. However, this flexibility must be balanced with the need to assure that students with 
disabilities, upon leaving high school, have a comprehensive summary of performance (SOP) that promotes self-
determination and productive post school outcomes. 
3. Since 2001, student attendance failed to meet the state’s requirements during testing days; However, in 2005, 
attendance on test days allowed the school to meet the annual attendance objectives as defined by the state. 
4. For the acceptability of online tutoring procedures, teachers and tutors all reported that the set-up was easy. 
Teachers, students, and tutors responded that some student materials could be clearer; However, overall the 
clarity of those materials was acceptable. 
5. An important increase in contaminant substances was found in Lake Ontario fish. PCNs have shown a dramatic 
decline since 1979; However, the levels are still above Ontario’s fish consumption advisory guidelines for dioxin-
like compounds. 
6. The poet Montoro witnessed some of the worst racial violence of his time and was forced to feel from his home 
in Cordoba (in 1473) during a riot. His poem to Enrique IV voices the frustration of a citizen who had lost hope 
that the persecution would end. However, his poem dedicated to Isabel illustrates that the presence of the new 
queen had restored in the poet some degree of optimism for the future. 
7. Usually, it’s better to take a multivitamin supplement with meals. With an empty stomach, you’ll absorb less of 
those vitamins. However, taking your multivitamin supplement on an empty stomach is much better than not 
taking it at all. 
8. If students with ID are auditing a class, then they are not receiving official university credit and are not 
required to submit assignments. However, if students with ID taking the course for credit, then those students 
must attempt to master all of the material which other students are expected to learn and submit all 
assignments as required in the syllabus. 
9. The Indian Removal Act of 1830 led to the forced relocation of thousands of Indian families from the Southeast 
to what is now Oklahoma. However, the growth and expansion of the white population has intensified the 
demand for Indian lands in most areas. 
10. Most items in the questionnaire represent statements to which the students responded to on a four-point 
modified Likert scale ranging from strongly agree, agree, disagree and strongly disagree. However, in the last 
three items, students were requested to give open answers. 
Rules to use however 
In the academic writing context, however is often used as a transitional device in the following two ways: 
1) to contrast two features/variables/attributes of one theme 
2) to contrast two features/variables/attributes of two themes that belong to the same category 
Activity 3 
Read examples 1-10 in activity 2 again. 
1) Circle the punctuation marks used before and after however. 
2) Compare the different uses of punctuation before and after however between examples 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 
examples 3, 4, 5. 
Language usage notes 
However is used as a coordinating conjunction to connect two independent clauses. Very often, a period, a 
punctuation mark to indicate the end of the first independent clause, is placed before However. In this case, the h in 
however should be capitalized, and a comma should be used after However (see examples 1 to 6). 
As shown in examples 7-10, a semicolon can also be used before however to connect two main clauses in a single 
However as a Transitional Device  |  123
sentence. In this case, the h in however should not be capitalized, and a comma should be used after however. Compared 
to a period, a semi-colon is preferred if the two clauses are short.

After I finished my first year of college, I decided to 
move off campus and I saw many differences between 
living on and off campus. However, there are many 
differences between living on and off campus that can 
impact on students’ health, academic performance, and

The writer is not presenting a contrast but adding 
information about the “many differences” of living in and off 
campus.

Korean, such as their alphabets, grammatical structure, 
and the use of honorifics. However, it is clear that 
Korean is harder to learn than English because of its

In the first sentence the writer establishes that A is different 
from B because of several reasons and mentions three of 
these differences as an example. The use of however in the 
second sentence announces a contrast. As such, one would 
expect that the writer would enlist some similarities between 
A and B (in spite of the differences previously mentioned), but 
that does not occur.

Although as a Transitional Device 
ALYS AVALOS-RIVERA AND YELIN ZHAO 
Based on the analysis of the uses of however in the previous section, we have learned that this transitional word is 
used to contrast features of one or two themes. In this section, we proceed to discuss another transitional device 
(i.e. although) that also serves the contrastive function. In fact, some students even view however and although as 
synonyms and think they can be used interchangeably. This false assumption leads to some inappropriate uses of these 
two transitional expressions in their writing. Task 1 intends to guide you to explore the differences between the uses of 
however and although. 
Activity 1 
In the following exercise you will find three passages that contain however and three passages that include although to 
present contrasts. Read the passages carefully and discuss the following questions with your peers: 
1) As you did in Activity 2 in the however chapter, in each of the following passages, first circle the theme(s) and 
then underline the features that are set in contrast. 
2) Within each passage, which sentence (Sentence [1] or [2]) introduces the contrast between features? 
3) Where in the passage is the transitional word placed? Sentence [1] or [2]? 
4) Using your responses, fill in the chart that appears below. 
1. [1] There is a general belief that compared to undergraduate students, graduate students are less likely to 
violate academic integrity since they are more mature and more educated. [2] Although the belief is prevalent, 
Brown (1995) reported that, in fact, graduate students are as likely to cheat as their undergraduate 
counterparts. 
2. [1] Badge and Scott (2009) pointed out that little research has been done to examine the impact of plagiarism 
detection tools on staff teaching practices. [2] Although a number of recent studies have considered 
educational use of Turnitin, they focused on individual programs or subject areas rather than institutions as a 
whole and the relationship with policy. 
3. [1] Activities which involved another party, such as copying and collaboration amongst students, created 
considerable diversity of opinion. [2] Although copying from other students was included in most definitions of 
plagiarism, for some participants from humanities and science, this was considered to be a different kind of 
cheating. 
4. [1]Plagiarism by students is an increasing issue at higher education institutions that require attention. [2] 
However, the development of academic misconduct policies has done little to reduce the incidence of 
plagiarism. 
5. [1] We intentionally offered students two articles in electronic form, available on the university Web site, and 
two printed in a journal, expecting that the electronic versions would be plagiarized more. [2] However, no 
differences in the plagiarism rate between the students who chose the electronic version of the source article 
or the paper version were actually found. 
6. [1] When electronic software tools for the detection of plagiarism first became available, many educators 
believed that they would provide an easily implemented solution, which would cut down on the hours of tedious 
manual detection. [2] However, within a short period of time, it became clear that electronic detection software

Rules to use although 
As we have learned in the previous chapter, however is often used as a coordinating conjunction to connect two 
independent clauses that are of equal importance. In contrast, as shown in examples 1-3, although is used to connect 
ideas that are within one sentence, so it functions as a subordinating conjunction. 
Activity 2 
Read the following examples very carefully. Pay attention to the grammar structure and punctuation used in each 
sentence and complete the following activities: 
1. Enclose the first clause of each passage using square brackets: [ ] 
2. Underline the second clause: _______________ 
3. In examples 2 through 5, which of the two clauses carries the central idea of the passage? Why is that so? 
(Example 1 has been done for you). 
4. Which clause is more important in examples 6 through 10? 
5. What differences can you find between examples 1-5 and 6-10? 
1. [Although professors and classroom teachers are extremely busy with all of their duties], adding components of job 
searching to teacher preparation will help candidates start their careers. 
The second clause (underlined) carries the central meaning of the passage. The writer wants to emphasize why it is 
important to add a job searching component to teacher education programs. 
2. Although many reading specialists would probably argue that reading is the most important skill students need to 
develop, the need to integrate technology into the school curriculum should not be overlooked. 
3. Although I still would like to find a way to increase my brain capacity, my interest has shifted toward student 
learning and brain development over the past several decades. 
4. Although research is less clear about the appropriate test level for academically gifted students, Warne (2014) 
Although as a Transitional Device  |  129
conducted a study in which gifted students were tested above level with a test that was 2 years more advanced than 
their grade level. 
5. Although the literature is mixed concerning whether online discussion boards are conducive to fostering students’ 
critical thinking skills, strong evidence suggests it is a learning environment ripe with possibilities for doing so. 
6. Learning is fundamental to life itself and we probably internalize from every life situation and experience, although 
we are not conscious of much of it. 
7. No local dengue fever cases were reported in 2013, although cases may have been underreported because of local 
physicians were not familiar with the disease. 
8. Historically, counselors have not been involved in the academic mission of the school (Adelman, 2002; House & 
Hayes, 2002), although recent research suggests an urgent need for them to be (Adelman, 2002; Clark & Amatea, 2004). 
9. Most test-takers managed to complete both choice exercises, although some only answered the first one. 
10. All the plants remained alive at the end of seawater treatments, although their vitality was strongly reduced. 
As you surely noticed, the sentences in this exercise follow two main patterns: 
Although + clause / , / clause 
Clause / , / although + clause 
In all the examples, the although+clause shows the contrast, while the other clause carries the central idea of the 
sentence. 
Rules to use although 
1. The clause that starts with although is a dependent clause, so it carries less important information than the other 
clause that is an independent clause. Use sentence [2] in passage 1 (Activity 1) as an example: the dependent clause 
“Although the belief is prevalent” is less important than the independent clause “graduate students are as likely to 
cheat as their undergraduate counterparts.” In what follows, the writer is very likely to talk about detailed information 
regarding Brown’s (1995) study instead of how prevalent the previous belief is. 
2. Regardless of the order used, you should always use a comma to separate the two clauses. 
3. Unlikehowever, although is never followed by a comma. 
4. It is also important to point out that since at least one sentence needs to be an independent clause, a sentence 
starts with “which,” as in the following example is ungrammatical: Although a number of recent studies have considered 
educational use of Turnitin, which focused on individual programs or subject areas rather than institutions as a whole 
and the relationship with policy. 
5. Additionally, you might have heard, read, or even written a sentence in which the construction “Although xxx, but 
xxx.” This structure is inappropriate. The reason is that but is unnecessary, and contrast has already been indicated in 
the word “although.” This error might be due to direct translation from some languages other than English.

Presenting Examples with 'such as' and 'for example' 
CAROL LYNN MODER 
It will be helpful for you to master some key expressions that we commonly use in academic writing in order to 
introduce specific examples. Two of the most common expressions of this type are such as and for example. 
You may think that these expressions are used in the same way and are interchangeable, but a closer look at the 
contexts of their use will reveal differences. Mastering these differences will help you greatly improve your academic 
writing. 
Look carefully at the following examples that show the most common way we use such as. 1 is from the introduction 
to an article. 
1. Ethnographic observations find that homemade meals often consist of convenience foods such as canned 
vegetables with heavy seasoning, frozen fried potato products that would be reheated in the oven, macaroni and 
cheese out of the box, and hot dogs as the main meat item
1. 
2 is a similar example from the results section of a journal article. 
2. Results on food preparation ability of the students in this study are presented in Table 1. A large percent 
(=90%) of the students knew how to make basic foods such as hamburgers, tacos, mashed potatoes, and 
scrambled eggs. In contrast, a relatively small percent (=25%) of the students knew how to make quiche, pizza 
sauce, basic salad dressings, or mayonnaise.

Look closely at these examples. What phrases occur before such as? What occurs after such as? What do you note 
about the punctuation and capitalization?

Phrase After 
For example, 
For example, 
Now consider 3 and 4, which show the most common way we use for example.  
3. In the context of this study, treats are sugary or salty snack items that fall outside the bounds of “eating 
right” or meeting children’s basic nutritional needs. Treats serve several purposes in mother– child interactions. 
In most cases, treats are used as a reward for children’s good behavior. For example, Nora in San Antonio would 
buy her daughters pudding cups, fruit roll-ups, or ice cream for good behavior. 
 
4. When mothers are short on funds, they often use cheaper and less healthful foods to substitute for those 
they cannot afford. For example, Karen in Chicago would try to buy as many fresh foods as possible as soon as 
her food stamp benefits are deposited in her account. 
 
Look closely at these examples. What kind of phrase occurs before for example? What occurs after for example? What 
do you note about the punctuation and capitalization?

'such as' 
CAROL LYNN MODER 
The expression such as is used to provide specific examples to illustrate the category named by the noun or noun 
phrase that comes immediately before it. 
In the sentence from 1 above, repeated here, the writer makes the general category basic foods more specific by 
naming the list of examples that follow such as. These are hamburgers, tacos, mashed potatoes, and scrambled eggs. 
A large percent (=90%) of the students knew how to make basic foods such as hamburgers, tacos, mashed potatoes, 
and scrambled eggs. 
5a shows us a slightly different use of such as ‘ 
5a.  Silver (1996) demonstrated how college students use objects either as “anchors” to maintain previous 
identities or as “markers” to construct new identities. Anchor objects, such as dolls or baseball cards, were those 
left at home, while marker objects, such as photographs or music, were those brought into the college dorms. 
 
In the first sentence in 5a, the writers are introducing key terms – anchors and markers -from previous research. In 
the next sentence, they further explain what these terms mean by stating that anchor objects are those students left 
at home, while marker objects are those students brought with them to college. They provide specific examples to help 
the reader understand what each type of object might be with the terms following such as – dolls or baseball cards and 
photographs or music . Note that in this example, the such as phrase is separated from the rest of the sentence by 
commas. The commas help to separate the examples in the such as phrase from the rest of the sentence. In this case 
the items mentioned in the such as phrase provide additional information. We know that the phrases provide additional 
information because the sentence would be grammatically acceptable and understandable if we leave out the examples 
in the such as phrase, as we see in 5b. 
 
5b. Anchor objects were those left at home, while marker objects were those brought into the college dorms. 
 
Phrases using such as are: 
• inserted into a complete sentence or main clause, 
◦ o Complete sentence 
Anchor objects were those left at home. 
• immediately after the noun that the examples are specifying 
◦ o Insertion 
Anchor objects, such as dolls or baseball cards, were those left at home. 
 
Punctuation for such as 
If: 
• such as follows a general noun, 
General nouns that often come before such as include: 
items, things, issues, areas, factors, variables, activities, events 
'such as'  |  139
• the phrase that follows gives short specific examples from the category the general noun describes 
then it may occur without commas before such as 
          (As we see in 1 and 2) 
 
Otherwise, such as should have a comma before it. 
 
If the examples not at the end of the sentence and are followed by a long phrase, there should also be a comma 
after them. 
(As we see in 5a.) 
 
NOTE: If you are in doubt, it is better to separate the such as phrase with commas, than to omit the commas.  Using 
the commas will make it easier for the reader to follow your sentence. 
 
SENTENCE FRAGMENT WARNING 
Such as must be inserted into a complete main clause; it cannot stand by itself in a separate sentence. 
Students left anchor objects at home. Such as dolls or baseball cards. 
THIS IS NOT GRAMMATICAL! 
Such as must be attached to the same sentence in which the noun it specifies appears. 
 
WORD ORDER WARNING 
The such as phrase must directly follow the noun that it specifies; it cannot be put elsewhere in the clause. 
Students left anchor objects at home, such as dolls or baseball cards. 
 
THIS IS NOT GRAMMATICAL! The such as specifies the category anchor objects, so it must come directly after this 
noun phrase. 
Punctuation Exercise: Such as 
Look at the following examples from a research article and explain why the authors use or do not use a comma. 
The authors argued that some of our emotions, such as disgust, are learned through our interaction with 
others in food related activities. 
Several individuals described items such as fruit salad, homemade bread, or homemade cookies as their 
comfort food.

'For example': Introducing a Sentence 
CAROL LYNN MODER 
The most common use of for example in academic writing is the use we saw in 3 and 4. For example introduces a specific 
example of an idea or concept that has been described in the preceding sentence. The most common use of for example 
in academic writing puts it at the beginning of a complete sentence. 
 
3. In most cases, treats are used as a reward for children’s good behavior. For example, Nora in San Antonio 
would buy her daughters pudding cups, fruit roll-ups, or ice cream for good behavior. 
 
For example is most commonly: 
• After a complete sentence that introduces a main idea or concept 
• At the beginning of a second complete sentence or main clause 
◦ o The first letter of For is capitalized because it is the beginning of a new sentence. 
◦ o For example is followed by a comma to separate it from the full sentence that follows it’ 
 
SENTENCE FRAGMENT WARNING 
For example must be attached to a complete main clause; it cannot appear by itself followed only by a list of items. 
 
Treats are used as a reward for children’s good behavior. For  example, pudding cups, fruit roll-ups, or ice cream for 
good behavior. 
THIS IS NOT GRAMMATICAL! 
What follows for example here is just a list of noun phrases. There is no finite verb in this sentence, so it is a fragment, 
not a complete sentence. The for example phrase that appears at the beginning, must introduce a complete sentence 
 
In 3, the first sentence states one of the findings of the research study, that mothers use treats to reward children for 
good behavior. The next sentence gives a specific example of this from one of the participants in the study. The phrase 
For example, alerts the reader that the sentence that comes after it is going to provide an example of the idea described 
in the previous sentence.

'For example': Inside a Sentence 
CAROL LYNN MODER 
We have described the most common uses in academic writing of For example and such as. If you master these uses and 
choose only to use them as we have described so far, you will not be likely to make errors. However, there is a second 
common use of for example, which you will encounter and which you may want to understand more fully. This use is 
shown in 6. 
 
6. Some attention needs to be devoted to the intricacies of our language. Students are in need of assistance 
dealing with the following: homograph and homonym. The former are words that are spelled the same, for 
example, Bow of the ship and Bow and arrow. The latter are words with a different spelling that possess the same 
sound, such as, to, too and two; plane and plain.
1 
 
The use in 6, is very similar to the use of such as that we saw earlier. In fact, as we see here, the writer uses for 
example to introduce the examples for the first noun phrase and such as to introduce the second. So inside a sentence 
for example can be used in place of such as, BUT such as CANNOT be used everywhere you can use for example. 
 
Such as is very restricted in its use, but for example can be used in more varied contexts. As we saw earlier, For example
can be used at the beginning of a sentence but such as CANNOT. Inside a sentence, such as MUST immediately follow 
the noun or noun phrase that it specifies, but for example can occur in other places inside the sentence. 
 
Let’s look at some uses of for example inside a sentence, where such as CANNOT be used. 
 
7. The data analysis revealed several student ideas for situating writing course activity within digital contexts. A 
few interviewees, for example, discussed the possibility of having a course Facebook page, where students could 
interact with one another and the teacher to ask questions about homework.
2 
 
In 7, for example follows a noun, but it does not introduce examples that specify that noun. We could NOT use such as 
in this context. The whole sentence in which for example occurs, is provided as an example of what the sentence before 
describes. In 7, the first sentence states that the analysis revealed several student ideas for course activities. The entire 
following sentence gives an example of those student ideas. So, the context for using for example inside the sentence 
use, is the same as the context that we saw in examples 3 and 4 when For example occurred at the beginning of the 
sentence. 
 
For example does not have to follow a noun or noun phrase, though. 
Look closely at examples 8-12. What kind of phrase occurs before for example? What occurs after for example? What 
do you note about the punctuation and capitalization? 
 
8. Many refugee children and youth do not have any print literacy skills. Take, for example, Jaabriil, a student

and ethnicity of his family’s Somali roots. Jaabriil came to Canada when he was 12 years old. Although he spent

9. By bringing students’ nonacademic digital literacies into writing education, teachers can facilitate students’ 
critical thinking about the technologies they use. When Facebook is used in class activities, for example, teachers 
can prompt students to discuss the construction of Facebook itself; a discussion of Facebook data collection can 
lead students to become more aware of how the site provides information to advertisers.
4 
 
10. The assessment techniques should be aligned not only with the course outcomes, but also with the 
performance that learners/workers will be expected to achieve as a result of the new learning. If the course 
is on programming, for example, it only makes sense that learners demonstrate their learning through a final 
submission of a computer program project.

11. In many states, a much larger percentage of students obtain the highest label of proficiency. In Utah, for 
example, 53% of examinees of the state-mandated language arts tests had “substantial” proficiency.

12. The students generally reported understanding very little about loans before borrowing for the first time, 
but described the actual process of applying for a loan as fairly painless. Emily, for example, estimated the entire

As we see from these examples, for example can occur after verbs (take), prepositional phrases (in Utah), nouns or noun 
phrases (Emily, a few interviewees) or dependent clauses (When Facebook is used in class activities, If the course is on 
programming). Note that in all cases, it is inserted into what is otherwise a complete sentence. 
How do we decide where to place for example in a sentence? To answer this question, we need to consider the larger 
context of the writing and what the writer wishes to highlight.

'For example': Inside a Sentence  |  143
• What information does the for example sentence give us in relation to the first sentence? 
• What part of the for example sentence is the focus of the example? 
When For example occurs at the beginning of the sentence, the entire following sentence illustrates the point being 
made in the first sentence. In 3, repeated here, the author is presenting findings showing that parents use treat to 
reward good behavior. The full following sentence is an example of this, specifying how one parent, Nora, used specific 
treats, pudding cups, fruit roll-ups or ice cream, to reward good behavior. Thus, the whole second sentence serves as 
the example of the concept in the previous sentence. 
 
3. In most cases, treats are used as a reward for children’s good behavior. For example, Nora in San Antonio 
would buy her daughters pudding cups, fruit roll-ups, or ice cream for good behavior. 
 
Compare that to 11. Here the first sentence introduces facts about student proficiency that are true in many states. 
The following sentence, gives us a sample of this by highlighting the specific percentage from only one state, Utah. The 
writer makes the information about states the focus of this section, so for example is put after the phrase In Utah. 
 
11. In many states, a much larger percentage of students obtain the highest label of proficiency. In Utah, for 
example, 53% of examinees of the state-mandated language arts tests had “substantial” proficiency.
8 
 
Similarly, in 13 we again find for example after a prepositional phrase. This time the example is one of a set of items 
that the writers mentioned before. The authors’ point in this section is that many texts that are part of curriculum have 
vocabulary and other features that are too difficult for the students. They introduce the names of three difficult works 
and then they use details about one of them to illustrate their point. For example is placed after the name of the title 
selected for the example. 
 
13. In a typical junior high class, students are expected to read such works as Homer’s The Odyssey, William 
Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet, or Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird. Many aspects of these wonderful and 
important texts might prove difficult for readers including vocabulary, themes and text structure. In To Kill 
a Mockingbird, for example, readers need to read and know the meanings of such words as assuaged, foray, 
impudent and taciturn.
9 
 
 
For example can also be used to highlight one of a series of examples in a section of writing. We see this in 10. Here 
the focus of the section is on assessment techniques and the main point is that these techniques need to match what 
the work learners will be able to do. Two specific illustrations are used, the first is for a course on programming. The 
second is for mobile learning applications. Here dependent clauses that begin with If specify examples of courses in 
which worker performances could be assessed. The writer uses for example after the first if clause to highlight that this 
is one of a series of conditions that illustrate the point in the prior sentence. 
10. The assessment techniques should be aligned not only with the course outcomes, but also with the 
performance that learners/workers will be expected to achieve as a result of the new learning. If the course 
is on programming, for example, it only makes sense that learners demonstrate their learning through a final

submission of a computer program project. Similarly, if the mobile learning application offers video modules on 
the features of medical equipment, the learner should be able to share those features in a presentation format. 
As we have seen in these examples, the location of for example depends on what the writer has written in the previous 
sentences and what the writer wants to do with the example. For example is most commonly placed at the beginning 
of the sentence. If for example is placed inside the sentence, it is generally placed immediately AFTER a phrase that 
highlights the writer’s focus.

_______________, to reject meat, or to not steal from strangers. 
D. Certainly beans come in a mosaic of colors that can rival those of fruits and vegetables — from the plain 
white great northern and navy beans, to the mottled brownish pink pintos, to the cranberry bean’s cream color 
with red streaks and flecks, the light and dark reds of kidney beans, the maroon-red adzuki, all the way to the 
black bean. The bean industry has exacting standards for maintaining these colors. ” It’s so strict, ” says Hosfield, 
” that pinto beans, ______________ , have to not only have just the right brown mottling and shades of pink, 
but also show a yellow rim around the’ belly button,’ or scar, where the bean was once attached to the pod. 
E. Writing in the content classes can add much to the learning process. In science class, 
________________ , before having students read about a concept, teachers can find out what students 
already know about the subject by having them write for a short time.

PREFACE: WRITING FOR 
COLLEGE 
Welcome to our creative commons OER (open educational 
resource) for Writing 121 at the University of Oregon.  This 
resource is designed for students to be a zero-cost, high-quality 
guide to academic writing, with the goal of preparing you for 
success in college and beyond. 
Audience, Purpose, Context 
Four key elements will shape much of the writing you are 
asked to do in college. Students, professional writers, editors, 
and publishers all consider these elements when they begin a 
new writing project: 
1. Purpose: The reason the writer composes a piece of 
writing. 
2. Tone: The attitude the writer conveys about the topic 
and the intended audience. 
3. Audience: The individual or group the writer intends 
to address. 
4. Content: The subject matter and ideas contained in a 
piece of writing. 
 
Figure 1 Purpose, Audience, Tone, and Content Triangle 
Your purpose, audience, and tone shape the content of each 
new writing task you will complete during college. These 
might 
include 
essays, 
research 
reports, 
scholarship 
applications, cover letters, and more. 
The purpose for a piece of writing identifies what a writer 
is trying to accomplish with their writing and the reasons 
motivating them to write.  Basically, the purpose of a piece 
of writing answers the question “Why write it?” For example, 
why write a play? To entertain a packed theater. Why write 
X  |  PREFACE: WRITING FOR COLLEGE
an email to your employees? To inform them of changes in 
policies or procedures. Why write a letter to your Senator? To 
persuade her to address your community’s needs. Why keep a 
diary? To keep a record of your journey through life. Knowing 
your purpose for any given writing task will help you remain 
focused and coherent. 
The audience for your writing is the expected reader or 
readers. An audience may be a certain professor, a group of 
classmates, people who research a subject you are writing 
about, or a wider community. Consider the specific traits of 
your audience members and what might be appealing or 
interesting to them. Use your imagination to anticipate your 
potential readers’ demographics, education, prior knowledge, 
and expectations. This will ensure that you are as detailed as 
you need to be in your writing. 
Tone identifies a writer or speaker’s attitude toward their 
topic. You may pick up a person’s tone of voice fairly easily 
in conversation, and the same is often true of writing. Just as 
speakers transmit emotion through voice and signers through 
body language, writers can create a range of attitudes, from 
excited and humorous to dry and critical. Tone creates 
intentional and unintentional emotional responses from 
readers. Ultimately, a good writer strives to build a relationship 
between the audience and their text using tone. To stimulate 
these connections, writers reflect attitudes and feelings with 
useful devices, such as sentence structure, word choice, 
PREFACE: WRITING FOR COLLEGE  |  XI
punctuation, and formal or informal language. Keep in mind 
that the attitude of your writing should always appropriately 
match the audience and the purpose. 
Keep the big picture elements of purpose, audience, and tone 
in mind while reading this resource and engaging in your own 
writing process.  We hope the ideas and lessons provided here 
give you a useful starting place to write with greater confidence 
and skill in college as you encounter the demands and 
expectations of academic coursework.  First-year writing 
courses are required at nearly every college and university in 
the world, so nearly every college student encounters these 
common ideas about writing. Students of various ages, 
identities, backgrounds, academic backgrounds all take first-
year writing courses at various points in their journey through 
college, and we hope after engaging with these materials that 
you find a sense of belonging with other writers and feel ready 
to take on any writing challenge. Writing as Inquiry is 
informed by our combined 30+ years of teaching experience, 
our engagement with current research and best practices in 
the field of Composition and Rhetoric, and a keen sense of 
developments in writing instruction and assessment across 
Oregon. 
Territorial Acknowledgment 
The University of Oregon is located on Kalapuya ilihi, the 
XII  |  PREFACE: WRITING FOR COLLEGE
traditional indigenous homeland of the Kalapuya people. 
Following treaties between 1851 and 1855, Kalapuya people 
were dispossessed of their indigenous homeland by the United 
States government and forcibly removed to the Coast 
Reservation in Western Oregon. Today, Kalapuya descendants 
are primarily citizens of the Confederated Tribes of Grand 
Ronde and the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians, and they 
continue to make important contributions to their 
communities, to the UO, to Oregon, and to the world. 
In following the Indigenous protocol of acknowledging the 
original people of the land we occupy, we also extend our 
respect to the nine federally recognized Indigenous nations 
of Oregon: the Burns Paiute Tribe, the Confederated Tribes 
of the Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians, the 
Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde, the Confederated 
Tribes of Siletz Indians, the Confederated Tribes of the 
Umatilla Indian Reservation, the Confederated Tribes of 
Warm Springs, the Coquille Indian Tribe, the Cow Creek 
Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians, and the Klamath Tribes. 
We express our respect to the many more tribes who have 
ancestral connections to this territory, as well as to all other 
displaced Indigenous peoples who call Oregon home. Hayu 
masi.

Thanks and Acknowledgments 
We began this project to provide our students and colleagues 
a high-quality, zero-cost alternative to well-liked but expensive 
publishing company textbooks like They Say / I Say for use in 
first-year writing courses at the University of Oregon. We – the 
authors, Kara Clevinger and Stephen Rust – hope the project 
carries forward the University of Oregon’s proud tradition of 
first-year writing for a new generation. We are particularly 
indebted to the scholarly works of UO faculty members John 
Gage, including The Shape of Reason (1986) and James 
Crosswhite, including Reading, Reasoning, and Writing
(2015), and the mentorship of former program directors Anne 
Laskaya and Carolyn Bergquist. 
The scholarly field of Composition and Rhetoric studies 
remains rife with debate over what counts as “good writing” 
in college, who gets to decide what counts as “good writing” 
in college, and how much agency students and teachers should 
each have in those decisions.  While we follow these arguments 
and current research in the field attentively and they inform 
many aspects of this project, please keep in mind that this 
project is a learning resource and not a research monograph, 
so citations have necessarily been kept to a minimum to focus 
readers’ attention on the task at hand – gaining the 
foundational skills to write with curiosity, precision, rigor, and 
charm and developing the self-efficacy to tackle any writing 
task in college with success. 
The project was funded by a University of Oregon Knight 
Libraries Digital Scholarship Award. Our thanks to Director 
of Digital Scholarship Services Franny Gaede and Open 
Educational Resources Librarian Rayne Vieger for their 
commitment to our project and for providing intellectual, 
technical, and fair use advice and organizational support.  Our 
thanks also to the 2020-2021 UO Composition program 
administrators, Spike Gildea, Nick Recktenwald, and Emily 
Simnitt for supporting our digital scholarship award 
application and every step of the project. And a huge thank 
you to Ryan Davies for a keen eye in helping us edit and polish 
this resource.

Learning 
Outcomes 
But What Do These 
Really Mean? 
Describe and practice writing 
as a multi-faceted process of 
inquiry, learning, and 
expression. 
Writing is a process that involves 
asking questions in order to 
explore and learn more about a 
topic so that you can formulate 
and express your own ideas—you 
are part of the production of 
knowledge at the university. 
Practice writing as a social 
process through 
compassionate and critical 
response to your peers’ work 
and revision of your writing 
in response to peer and 
instructor feedback. 
Writing is not merely a solitary 
activity done in the dark corner of 
a library or hunched over the desk 
of your room; it involves engaging 
other perspectives—those you 
read and those of your peers—as 
well as giving and getting 
feedback. 
Compose arguments in 
discussion and writing 
through open and curious 
engagement with multiple 
perspectives. 
College writing is about 
discovering and expressing your 
point of view, but you must also 
be open to other points of view. 
Learning is pushing the 
boundaries of what you know 
and believe. 
Develop audience awareness 
and practice respectful 
treatment of audience. 
Successful writing is purposeful 
and clear, and keeping your 
reader in mind will ignite your 
purpose and clarify your ideas. 
4  |  1A. LEARNING OUTCOMES FOR WR 121
Identify and critically apply 
style requirements for 
writing in an academic 
context. 
You’ll learn MLA style to format 
your essays, and you’ll work on 
improving your vocabulary and 
sentences as you develop your 
distinct voice and style. 
 
How does the writing and work you do in WR 121 
transfer to your classes and career? 
You’ll practice critical thinking and analytical writing skills, 
as well as cultivate deep reading and cognitive patience with 
the texts we read. These are valuable skills on the job market 
and in life, and they are becoming increasingly rare in the age 
of fast-paced internet reading and posting. We hope you’re 
willing—maybe excited—to develop your critical reading and 
writing practice. By reading this creative commons resource 
and practicing the skills and methods explored, we hope you 
will feel more confident in your ability to handle a variety of 
writing situations.

The first major concept we discuss that will be the foundation 
of your reading and writing in Writing 121 is discourse 
community. Considering your discourse community can give 
your writing its audience, context, and purpose, which are 
crucial for motivating your writing. In this chapter, we will: 
• Define discourse community 
• Identify the various discourse communities of which 
you are a part 
• Understand how a discourse community shapes your 
writing 
• Consider ways to craft a unique voice within a discourse 
community 
• Reflect on how knowledge of discourse community can 
improve your writing 
What is a discourse 
community? 
To define this concept, let’s break it down into its separate 
parts: discourse and community. We’ll start with the simpler 
word, community. A community is simply a group of people 
who are joined together by something they have in common. 
It could be a shared interest, such as a gaming community, a set 
of beliefs, such as a religious community, a similar geographical 
location, such as a local community, or a profession, such as 
the academic community. A family is a type of community. 
Your friends also form a community. Take a moment and 
8  |  1B. DISCOURSE COMMUNITIES
think of the various communities to which you belong. What 
binds individuals together in these communities? Do members 
of these communities engage with each other virtually or in 
real life? 
 
Next let’s look at the other word in this term, discourse. The 
word in its original usage meant reasoned argument or 
thought. However, in contemporary usage we sometimes 
think of it generally as any written or spoken communication, 
a conversation. We more often use it to refer to written or 
spoken communication related to a particular intellectual or 
social activity, such as scientific discourse or political discourse. 
In this sense, a synonym for discourse might be language. A 
discourse is defined by its unique language, vocabulary, 
themes, ideas, values, and beliefs. Think about your major. 
What are the unique characteristics of the discourse in your 
disciplinary or professional field? 
 
Now 
let’s 
put 
our 
two 
words 
together, discourse 
community. Any guesses on what it means? If you are 
thinking that it is a group of people—real, imaginary, virtual, 
or otherwise—with shared interests, goals, language, and ways 
of communicating, then, yes, you’ve got it! 
 
1B. DISCOURSE COMMUNITIES  |  9
Image: Your WR 121 discourse community; Discussion icons created by 
Freepik – Flaticon 
What does a discourse 
community look like? 
Let’s work through a few examples. The following are five lists 
of words. Do you recognize any of the groups of words and 
what they have in common? 
1. CPA, general ledger, liabilities, return on investment, 
owner’s equity, net income, expenses (fixed, variable, 
accrued, operation) 
10  |  1B. DISCOURSE COMMUNITIES
2. ISO, aperture, depth of field, autofocus, exposure, 
shutter speed 
3. gracias, de nada, salud, buen provecho, estadounidense, 
te quiero 
4. wingardium leviosa, alohomora, stupefy, avada kedavra, 
oculus reparo, expelliarmus 
5. once a Duck always a Duck, show your “O,” Carson, 
EMU, it never rains in Autzen Stadium, Arts and 
Letters, Social Science, and Science groups 
  
  
  
 
  
If you are a business major and have taken an accounting class, 
you’ve likely learned about the set of words in #1. If you are 
a photographer, you probably know the terminology in #2. If 
you speak Spanish, then you understand the words in #3. If 
you’re a Harry Potter fan, then you recognize the words in #4 
as spells. And if you are a UO student, then the words in #5 
should seem familiar to you. Sco Ducks! 
1B. DISCOURSE COMMUNITIES  |  11
So you can see that discourse, or language, is one way that 
a community is bound together. It shapes it, strengthens it, 
and even defines it. The members of the community generally 
agree on what the terms mean; however, that is not always the 
case, as we will explore later in the course. 
But what if you didn’t know a group of words? Let’s say you 
are in a conversation with a group of people using the technical 
terms in #2, but your only camera is your iPhone. Or perhaps 
you are reading an article that is in Spanish, but you don’t 
know that language. How would you feel? You would 
probably feel confused, frustrated, and excluded. 
Because language and modes of communication differ among 
various groups, a discourse community can exclude others as 
much as it brings people together. Think about one of the 
communities to which you belong. What is the discourse of 
that group? What is the shared language and terminology? 
What are the primary ways of communicating between 
members of the community? How do members communicate 
their ideas or activities with those outside of the community? 
 
What is a discourse community to which you belong and. . . 
• What are the unique characteristics of communicating 
within this community? 
• How has it shaped the way you think and write? 
12  |  1B. DISCOURSE COMMUNITIES
• Is it possible to assert your unique voice within that 
community? How so or why not?

How does the discourse 
community shape your 
writing? 
In his book on academic writing, The Shape of Reason, John 
Gage defines a discourse community as “any kind of 
community in which the members attempt to achieve 
cooperation and assert their individuality through the use of 
1B. DISCOURSE COMMUNITIES  |  13
language. We are all members of discourse communities, each 
of which uses language in different ways” (2). 
What keywords can you pull out of this definition? I identify 
the 
following 
keywords: cooperation, individuality, 
and language. A community generally assumes members 
who cooperate with each other. The group has a common goal 
or set of goals and its members want to work or live together 
to achieve those goals. They use a common language and mode 
of communication to maintain and strengthen the community. 
For an individual to thrive within this community, 
understanding and being able to use that common language 
and mode of communication are essential. When we as 
individuals have thoughts, ideas, or actions we would like to 
share with others in the community, we want to convey those 
thoughts, ideas, or actions in a way that others can understand 
and engage with them. No one likes to feel misunderstood. 
In this way, a discourse community influences how we 
communicate our individuality to the group. 
We can illustrate how discourse community shapes your 
writing with a few examples. It is probably easy and fun for you 
to write and send texts to your friends. What kind of language 
do you use when texting? If your friend’s primary language is 
English, then you’ll probably use English in your texts. You’ll 
probably also use textspeak abbreviations like “lol” and “idk.” 
You might even use some visual language, such as emoji or gifs. 
If your friend does not speak English, does not know what 
14  |  1B. DISCOURSE COMMUNITIES
the abbreviations stand for, or is unfamiliar with emoji, then 
they will not understand your message. Now, let’s say you are 
sending an email to your professor. Would you use the same 
discourse that you use when texting your friend? Probably 
not. In other words: an awareness of discourse community 
probably already shapes how you communicate your ideas. 
This is all well and good when you feel confident about your 
membership in a community. But what about when you are 
new to a community? How do you learn that community’s 
discourse? Or what if you struggle to feel like you truly belong 
in a community? How do these things affect how you 
communicate and interact with the group? As you become 
more familiar with a community’s discourse, your written 
communication with the group will also improve. However, 
do you think it is possible to assert your unique voice and 
identity within the limits of a community’s discourse? 
Let’s consider the university as a discourse community. The 
university comprises intellectuals (including you!) in various 
academic disciplines. Each academic discipline has its own 
discourse, but for the most part all academic disciplines 
communicate and share knowledge, as well as debate theories 
and 
ideas, 
through 
discussion 
and 
writing. 
What 
characterizes academic discourse? What is academic writing? 
Who gets to speak and write in this community? 
Once you have read the sections on discourse community and 
1B. DISCOURSE COMMUNITIES  |  15
thought about the various communities of which you are a 
part and the discourses used in these communities, you’re 
ready to get to know your WR 121 discourse community. 
What can you learn about your peers and instructor? What 
languages do they speak? What common goals do you all 
share? Do you agree on what effective writing looks like? What 
support will you offer each other as you work on your writing 
this term?

How do successful writers meet 
these challenges? 
Writing doesn’t stop being challenging, even to the best 
writers. Successful writers have cultivated habits that help 
them meet the challenges of writing and the writing process 
with more confidence, but it doesn’t make the challenges less 
difficult; it just makes them (slightly) more manageable. 
Producing a “perfect” paper isn’t–and shouldn’t–be the goal 
for this class. But knowing what successful writing is and does, 
practicing the skills that give you confidence to engage any 
writing situation, and cultivating habits to grind through any 
challenge–these are realistic goals for your work in a first-year 
college writing course.

You can do it!; by Tom Kelly CC BY NC ND 2.0. 
What is your why?> 
Setting an intention for your writing practice this term will 
give you focus and purpose in your writing. Just like knowing 
your destination helps you plan your route, an intention is 
a goal that gives you direction so you don’t feel so lost and 
aimless. When you get stuck in your writing–and you will! we 
all do!–you can return to your intention to help motivate your 
writing. 
To help set your writing goal(s), you’ll want to consider the 
following questions: 
• What are the components of a college essay or other 
writing assignment? 
• What makes a piece of writing, even academic writing, 
interesting? 
• What are the habits of successful writers? 
• What do you accomplish by writing your ideas in college 
(or other settings)?

An Introduction to Reading in 
College 
While the best way to develop your skills as a writer is to 
actually practice by writing, practicing critical reading skills is 
crucial to becoming a better college writer. Careful and skilled 
readers develop a stronger understanding of topics, learn to 
better anticipate the needs of the audience, and pick up 
sophisticated writing “maneuvers” and strategies from 
professional writing. A good reading practice requires reading 
text and context, which you’ll learn more about in the next 
section. Writing a successful academic essay also begins with 
critical reading as you explore ideas and consider how to make 
use of sources to provide support for your writing. 
Questions to ask as you read 
If you consider yourself a particularly strong reader or want to 
improve your reading comprehension skills, writing out notes 
about a text—even if it’s in shorthand—helps you to commit 
the answers to memory more easily. Even if you don’t write 
out all these notes, answering these basic questions about any 
text or reading you encounter in college will help you get the 
most out of the time you put into your reading. It will also 
give you more confidence to understand and question the text 
while you read. 
• Is there context provided about the author and/or 
essay? If so, what stands out as important? 
Context in this instance means things like dates of publication, 
where the piece was originally published, and any biographical 
information about the author. All of that information will be 
important for developing a critical reading of the piece, so track 
what’s available as you read. 
• If you had to guess, who is the author’s 
intended audience? Describe them in as much detail as 
possible. 
Sometimes the author will state who the audience is, but 
sometimes you have to figure it out by context clues, such as those 
you tracked above. For instance, the audience for a writer 
on Buzzfeed is very different from the audience for a writer for 
the Wall Street Journal—and both writers know that, which 
means they’re more effective at reaching their readers. Learning 
how to identify your audience is a crucial writing skill for all 
genres of writing. 
28  |  2A. CRITICAL READING
• In your own words, what is the question the author is 
trying to answer in this piece? What seems to have 
caused them to write in the first place? 
In nonfiction writing of the kind we read in Writing 121, 
writers set out to answer a question. Their thesis/main argument 
is usually the answer to the question, so sometimes you can 
“reverse engineer” the question from that. Often, the question is 
asked in the title of the piece. 
• In your own words, what’s the author’s main idea or 
argument? If you had to distill it down to one or two 
sentences, what does the author want you, the reader, to 
agree with? 
If you’ve ever had to write a paper for a class, you’re probably 
familiar with a thesis or main argument. Published writers also 
have a thesis (or else they don’t get published!), but sometimes 
it can be tricky to find in a more sophisticated piece of writing. 
Trying to put the main argument into your own words can help. 
• How many examples and types of evidence did the 
author provide to support the main argument? Which 
examples/evidence stood out to you as persuasive? 
It’s never enough to just make a claim and expect people to believe 
it—we have to support that claim with evidence. The types of 
2A. CRITICAL READING  |  29
evidence and examples that will be persuasive to readers depends 
on the audience, though, which is why it’s important to have some 
idea of your readers and their expectations. 
• Did the author raise any points of skepticism (also 
known as counterarguments)? Can you identify exactly 
what page or paragraph where the author does this? 
As we’ll see later when the writing process, respectfully engaging 
with points of skepticism and counterarguments builds trust with 
the reader because it shows that the writer has thought about 
the issue from multiple perspectives before arriving at the main 
argument. Raising a counterargument is not enough, though. 
Pay careful attention to how the writer responds to that 
counterargument—is it an effective and persuasive response?  If 
not, perhaps the counterargument has more merit for you than 
the author’s main argument. 
• In your own words, how does the essay conclude? What 
does the author “want” from us, the readers? 
A conclusion usually offers a brief summary of the main 
argument and some kind of “what’s next?” appeal from the 
writer to the audience. The “what’s next?” appeal can take many 
forms, but it’s usually a question for readers to ponder, actions 
the author thinks people should take, or areas related to the main 
topic that need more investigation or research. When you read 
30  |  2A. CRITICAL READING
the conclusion, ask yourself, “What does the author want from 
me now that I’ve read their essay?” 
Reading Like Writers: Critical 
Reading 
Reading as a Creative Act 
“The theory of books is noble. The scholar of the 
first age received into him the world around; 
brooded thereon; gave it the new arrangement of 
his own mind, and uttered it again. It came into him 
life; it went out from him truth. It came to him short-
lived actions; it went out from him immortal 
thoughts. It came to him business; it went from him 
poetry. It was dead fact; now, it is quick thought. It 
can stand, and it can go. It now endures, it now flies, 
it now inspires. Precisely in proportion to the depth 
of mind from which it issued, so high does it soar, so 
long does it sing.” ~Ralph Waldo Emerson, “The 
American Scholar”

Objectives 
• Consider the discourse community when you read and 
write in your college classes 
• Analyze any reading for text and context 
• Read like a writer so you can write for your readers

By the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to apply the concept 
of discourse community to honing your college-level critical 
reading skills. 
Good writers are good readers, so let’s start there. When you 
can confidently identify the audience, context, and purpose 
of a text—position it within its discourse community—you’ll 
be a stronger, savvier reader. 
Strong, savvy readers are more effective writers because they 
consider their own audience, context, and purpose when they 
2A. CRITICAL READING  |  33
write and communicate, which makes their writing clearer and 
to the point. 
So the goal of this lesson is to help you read like a writer!

Why read critically? While the best way to develop your 
skills as a writer is to actually practice by writing, practicing 
critical reading skills is crucial to becoming a better writer. 
Careful and skilled readers develop a stronger understanding 
of topics, learn to better anticipate the needs of the audience, 
and pick up writing “maneuvers” and strategies from 
professional writing. 
 
2A. CRITICAL READING  |  35
Reading Like Writers 
How do you read like a writer? When you read like a writer, 
you are practicing deeper reading comprehension. In order to 
understand a text, you are reading not just what’s in it but 
what’s around it, too: text and context. 
TEXT 
CONTEXT 
• What is the main point 
of the text? 
• What is a key point, 
example, or passage that 
stood out to you? 
• What is one thing you 
need more information 
about? Or, what is one 
question you have about 
the content of the text? 
• Who is the author? Why 
should you trust them on 
this topic/issue? 
• When and where was the 
text first published? Who 
will read/see it? 
• How does the author 
address or appeal to their 
audience? 
• Why do you think the 
author wrote this piece? 
 
 
36  |  2A. CRITICAL READING
Practice: Reading Like Writers 
In-class discussion: Advertisements are helpful for practicing 
reading like writers because advertisers make deliberate choices 
with text and images based on audience (target consumer), 
context (where they are reaching them), and purpose (buy this 
product).

38  |  2A. CRITICAL READING
• How does this text—print 
ad—consider audience, 
context, and purpose? 
• Whom does it appeal to and 
how does it appeal to them? 
• What assumptions or 
stereotypes does the ad rely 
on the viewer sharing? 
• Do you know who Colin 
Kaepernick is? 
• What is the “sacrifice” that’s 
referred to here? 
• How do you interpret 
Kaepernick’s facial 
expression? 
• Why do you think the 
advertisers chose a close-up 
portrait? 
• Why use this image and 
messaging to sell Nike 
products? 
• Whom would this ad appeal 
to? 
• But I’m not trying to sell a product! How can I use my 
newfound understanding of audience, context, and 
purpose to improve my writing? 
It’s true! You aren’t selling a product. You aren’t (I hope) 
trying to manipulate your audience. You aren’t relying on 
discriminatory assumptions or stereotypes to appeal to your 
audience. But when you write, let’s say, an essay, you are asking 
readers to “buy into” your point of view. The goal doesn’t have 
to be for them to agree with you; it can be for your readers 
to respectfully consider, understand, or sympathize with your 
point of view or analysis of an issue. The point is you’re 
thinking of your reader when you write, and that will 
2A. CRITICAL READING  |  39
make your writing process smoother and your writing 
clearer. 
Writing for Your Readers 
 
When you write for your readers, you. . . 
• Learn from your reading and communication 
experience: What makes texts work? How are ideas 
conveyed clearly? 
• Analyze the writing situation: What are the goals and 
purpose for a writing project? Who is your 
audience? 
• Explore and play as you draft: What are different ways 
to respond? Can you use a better word or phrase? 
• Consider your audience: What might a reader expect 
to see? What does your reader need to understand 
your point of view? What questions might a reader 
have?

Writing as a process of inquiry 
Just as you want your readers to take you seriously, you want to 
approach texts with an open and curious mind. Whatever the 
topic, it was important enough for this person to want to write 
on it. While we don’t have to agree with the point someone is 
making, we can respect their opinion and appreciate reading a 
different perspective. 
Approach reading and writing in college in a learning zone. Be 
open, be curious, ask questions, seek answers. Share, 
stretch, experiment.

Purpose 
The object is to fill the empty space of the margins with your 
thoughts and questions to the text. By reading sympathetically 
(reading to understand what the writer is saying) and critically 
(reading to analyze and critique what the writer is saying), 
you are reading mindfully and creatively. You are finding those 
passages that you are drawn to, asking questions that you have, 
and beginning to develop your reaction, response, and ideas 
about a topic or issue. It’s a useful tool in the “getting started” 
phase of the writing process. Learning how to read effectively 
will be an invaluable skill in your college career and beyond

Summarizing Sources 
Writing with other voices 
In most of your college writing, which is evidence-based 
writing, you’ll need to incorporate sources. In some writing 
assignments, you’ll be asked to interpret and analyze a text 
or texts. The text is the subject of your writing, and your 
interpretation of the text will need to be supported with 
evidence from the text. In other writing assignments, you’ll 
need to support a thesis with evidence from texts and sources. 
When you incorporate a text or source should generally be 
performing one of four functions: 
• Helping to provide context for your inquiry or 
argument 
• Supporting a claim you are making 
• Illustrating a claim you are making 
• Providing a different perspective or counterargument to 
a claim you are making 
When you incorporate other voices–texts and sources–into 
your writing, you will either summarize, paraphrase, or quote 
them in order to distinguish them for your voice and ideas. 
 
Overview of Summarizing, 
Paraphrasing, and Quoting Texts 
and Sources 
Quotations must be identical to the original, using a narrow 
segment of the source. They must match the source document 
word for word and must be attributed to the original author. 
Paraphrasing involves putting a passage from source material 
into your own words. A paraphrase must also be attributed 
to the original source. Paraphrased material is usually shorter 
than the original passage, taking a somewhat broader segment 
of the source and condensing it slightly. 
Summarizing involves putting the main idea(s) into your 
own words, including only the main point(s). Once again, it is 
necessary to attribute summarized ideas to the original source. 
2B. READING ANALYSIS: SUMMARIZING, PARAPHRASING, AND
QUOTING  |  49
Summaries are significantly shorter than the original and take 
a broad overview of the source material. 
Writers frequently intertwine summaries, paraphrases, and 
quotations. As part of a summary of an article, a chapter, or a 
book, a writer might include paraphrases of various key points 
blended with quotations of striking or suggestive phrases as in 
the following example: 
In his article “What’s The Matter With College?,” Rick 
Perlstein argues that college, in American society and 
individual lives, is not as significant as it was in the 1960s, 
because colleges are no longer sites of radical protest, heated 
intellectual debate, or freedom from parental authority for 
students. Perlstein waxes nostalgic over the 1966 California 
gubernatorial race between Ronald Reagan and Pat Brown 
when the University of California’s Berkeley campus—a locus 
for “building takeovers, antiwar demonstrations and sexual 
orgies”—became a key campaign issue. These days, “[c]ollege 
campuses seem to have lost their centrality,” according to 
Perlstein, and do not offer a “democratic and diverse culture” 
that stood apart from the rest of society and constituted “the 
most liberating moment” in a student’s life (par. 1). 
Use the following pro tips as you read texts and sources so when 
it comes time to write you have quotations, paraphrases, and 
summaries ready! 
50  |  2B. READING ANALYSIS: SUMMARIZING, PARAPHRASING,
AND QUOTING
• Read the entire text, noting the key points and main 
ideas. 
• Summarize in your own words what the single main idea 
of the text is. 
• Paraphrase important supporting points that come up in 
the text. 
• Consider any words, phrases, or brief passages that you 
believe should be quoted directly. 
Summarizing Texts and Sources 
in Your Writing 
Generally speaking, a summary must at once be true to what 
the original author says while also emphasizing those aspects 
of what the author says that interest you, the writer. You need 
to summarize the work of other authors in light of your own 
topic and argument. Writers who summarize without regard 
to their own interests often create “list summaries” that simply 
inventory the original author’s main points (signaled by words 
like “first,” “second,” “and then,” “also,” and “in addition”), 
but fail to focus those points around any larger overall claim. 
Writing a good summary means not just representing an 
author’s view accurately but doing so in a way that fits the 
larger agenda of your own piece of writing. 
The following is a two-sentence template* for a summary 
adapted from the work of writing scholar Katherine 
2B. READING ANALYSIS: SUMMARIZING, PARAPHRASING, AND

Woodworth that captures 1) info on the author/text and the 
text’s main point; and 2) the point or example that relates to 
the point you’re making: 
[Author’s credentials] [author’s first and last name] in his/
her [type of text] [title of text], published in [publishing 
info] addresses the topic of [topic of text] and argues/
reports 
that [argument/general

[Author’s

See the two-sentence summary template in action: 
Example. English professor and textbook author Sheridan 
Baker, in his essay “Attitudes” (1966), asserts that writers’ 
attitudes toward their subjects, audiences, and themselves 
determine to a large extent the quality of their prose. Baker 
gives examples of how negative attitudes can make writing 
unclear, pompous, or boring, concluding that a good writer 
“will be respectful toward his audience, considerate toward his 
readers, and somehow amiable toward human failings” (58). 
NOTE that the first sentence identifies the author (Baker), 
the genre (essay), the title and date, and uses an active verb 
(asserts) and the relative pronoun that to explain what exactly 
Baker asserts. The second sentence gives more specific detail 
on a relevant point Baker makes. 
More examples!

Example. In his essay “On Nature” (1850), British 
philosopher John Stuart Mill argues that using nature as a 
standard for ethical behavior is illogical. He defines nature as 
“all that exists or all that exists without the intervention of 
man.” 
Example. In his essay “Panopticism,” French philosopher 
Michel Foucault argues that the “panopticon” is how 
institutions enforce discipline and conformity by making every 
subject feel like they are being watched by a central authority 
with the capability of punishing wrongdoing. He concludes 
that it should not be “surprising that prisons resemble 
factories, schools, barracks, hospitals, which all resemble 
prisons” (249). 
Example. Independent scholar Indur M. Goklancy, in a policy 
analysis for the Cato Institute, argues that globalization has 
created benefits in overall “human well-being.” He provides 
statistics that show how factors such as mortality rates, child 
labor, lack of education, and hunger have all decreased under 
globalization. 
NOTE that the above examples prompt the writer to develop 
a more detailed interpretation and explanation of the point/
example made in the second sentence. That’s the work of 
developing a paragraph with a text or source! You can see what 
that looks like more fully in Integrating Quotes and

Integrating Quotes and 
Paraphrases into Writing 
 
Image: Sculpting from raw material; Piqsels 
54  |  2B. READING ANALYSIS: SUMMARIZING, PARAPHRASING, AND
QUOTING
“Integrating” means to combine two or more separate 
elements or things into a cohesive whole. Obviously, as you 
bring other perspectives (readings and texts) into your writing, 
you’re combining the work and words of others with your 
own original ideas. However, you should be strategic in the 
choices that you make–not every author needs to be quoted 
directly, not every passage of text needs to have every word or 
phrase quoted directly, and not every source will contribute 
multiple quotes or paraphrases to your essay. That’s why we 
like the analogy of a sculptor at this point in the writing 
process. Now that you’ve collected the raw material you need 
to support your argument through thorough research, it’s 
time to shape it carefully and deliberately so that it combines 
with your own writing to create an appealing experience for 
your reader. On to the sculpting! 
 
When to Paraphrase: 
• When you need to communicate the main idea of a 
source, but the details are not relevant/important 
• When the source isn’t important enough to take up 
significant space 
• Any time you feel like you can state what the source 
claims more concisely or clearly 
• Any time you think you can state what the source claims 
2B. READING ANALYSIS: SUMMARIZING, PARAPHRASING, AND
QUOTING  |  55
in a way that’s more appealing to the reader 
When to quote directly: 
• When incorporating an influential or significant voice 
into your essay 
• The words themselves clearly back up your claims, and 
come from a good authority 
• The words are unique/original, and already clearly 
express your key concepts in a compelling or interesting 
way 
• There’s no better way to present those main ideas to the 
reader than how the original author has stated them 
• When engaging with a source that disagrees with you, so 
you can state the argument fairly 
 
A note on “cherry-picking”: Cherry-picking is a pejorative 
term that refers to writers using quotes or paraphrases to 
support their own argument, even though the source would 
likely disagree with how their words or ideas are being used. 
Responsible academic writing means presenting evidence in 
a context that’s consistent and appropriate with the source’s 
original use of the quote or paraphrase.

Placing Direct Quotes in Your 
Essay 
Here’s a helpful acronym that will remind you of the 
steps to take to most effectively incorporate direct 
quotations into your argument: I.C.E  (Introduce, Cite, 
Explain). I’ll use it as a verb to remind myself when 
constructing a paragraph: “Did I make sure to ICE my 
quotes?” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2B. READING ANALYSIS: SUMMARIZING, PARAPHRASING, AND

Image: Ice, Ice, baby; Pexels, CC0 
Introduce: 
Introduce the quote before providing it. Sometimes this is as 
simple as “Author X states” or some variation of that phrase. If 
it’s the first time you’re quoting an author, it’s a good idea to 
give the author’s full name, but you can rely on the surname 
in subsequent quotations. If there is context you’d like the 
reader to know about source, it’s generally wise to provide that 
before the quote, as part of its introduction. Avoid using “says” 
when introducing quotations unless you are citing a speech, 
interview, or other spoken text; “writes,” “states,” “explains,” 
“argues,” etc. are better options. 
Cite: 
Every style (MLA, APA, Chicago) has different formats for 
citations, 
but 
anything 
that 
isn’t 
common 
knowledge–whether you’re directly quoting or paraphrasing, 
must come with a citation. We’re using MLA format in this 
class, so make sure you understand the rules of MLA Citations 
and Formatting. 
Example: In the “Higher Laws” chapter of Walden, 
Henry David Thoreau seems to become despondent 
58  |  2B. READING ANALYSIS: SUMMARIZING, PARAPHRASING,
AND QUOTING
over his inability to overcome what he calls “this slimy 
beastly life” (148). 
(For reference, the introduction of the quote is underlined, while 
the citation is bolded; you won’t do this when you actually cite. 
If you introduce a quote by using the author’s name, you only 
need to provide the page number where the quote can be found. 
Otherwise, their last name will also need to appear in the 
citation.) 
 
Explain: 
You should always take time to explain quotations, 
paraphrases, and other types of evidence that you include. 
Readers look for your analysis of evidence in academic writing, 
and without it, a reader may draw different conclusions about 
the relationship between evidence and claim than you do. This 
is why the basic format for making an argument in academic 
writing is claim –> evidence to support claim –> reasons why you 
think the evidence supports the claim. 
The Explanation of a quote or paraphrase is where you’re 
showing the reader your critical thinking, analytical 
skills, and ability to present your original ideas clearly 
and concisely. It is the part of the essay where you’re 
2B. READING ANALYSIS: SUMMARIZING, PARAPHRASING, AND
QUOTING  |  59
really presenting your original ideas and perspectives on 
a topic–that makes it very important! 
 
Template for a Paragraph with 
Direct Quotes 
As you read the following example, note 
where we are Introducing, Citing, and 
Explaining the quote. 
Example: As I argue above, Thoreau is burdened by 
the implications of his animal appetites, of the intrinsic 
sensuality of living in the material world. However, 
Thoreau’s own language may be creating a heavier 
burden than he realizes. In Philosophy of Literary Form, 
Kenneth Burke writes: “. . .if you look for a man’s 
burden, you will find the principle that reveals the 
structure of his unburdening; or, in attenuated form, if 
you look for his problem, you find the lead that explains 
the structure of his solution” (92, emphasis in original). 
As this quote suggests, Burke believes that the answer 
to the problem often lies in the way that the problem is 
presented by the author or poet. His description of life 
as “beastly” and “slimy” is an ironic reframing of similar 
natural elements as those that brought him to Walden

AND QUOTING
Pond in the first place. Thoreau’s choice of terminology 
to describe something results in the shifting of his 
attention and priorities. 
To think about how I’m structuring this body paragraph, let’s 
break it down into its constituent parts: 
1) Topic sentence: As I argued above, Thoreau is burdened 
by the implications of his animal appetites, of the intrinsic 
sensuality of living in the material world. This is what the 
paragraph will be about–Thoreau’s burdens–and I’m 
telling the reader in one quick phrase how this connects 
to another part of the essay. 
2) Paragraph’s Main Claim: However, Thoreau’s own 
language may be creating a heavier burden than he 
realizes. This is the main claim I’m making to my reader 
and is what the rest of the paragraph needs to focus 
on supporting with evidence and my own analysis. Each 
paragraph should generally only have one main claim so 
the reader can stay focused on the argument at hand. 
3) The Evidence: In Philosophy of Literary Form, Kenneth 
Burke writes: “. . .if you look for a man’s burden, you will find 
the principle that reveals the structure of his unburdening; or, 
in attenuated form, if you look for his problem, you find the 
lead that explains the structure of his solution” (92, emphasis 
his). Whether a direct quote or a paraphrase or both, 
there should be evidence of some sort in all of your body 
2B. READING ANALYSIS: SUMMARIZING, PARAPHRASING, AND
QUOTING  |  61
paragraphs (and sometimes in your intro and conclusion, 
too). It should clearly support the main claim and be 
cited, whether a quote or a paraphrase. Note that this 
evidence has the “I” and the “C” of ICE. The next step 
has the “E.” 
4) The Explanation: As this quote suggests, Burke believes 
that the answer to the problem often lies in the way that the 
problem is presented by the author or poet. His description of 
life as “beastly” and “slimy” is an ironic reframing of similar 
natural elements as those that brought him to Walden Pond 
in the first place. As mentioned above, this is arguably the 
most critical part of the paragraph. Depending on the 
evidence and your audience, your explanation might 
need to summarize the quote in your own words (if it’s 
complex), but it absolutely needs to analyze the evidence 
(quote or paraphrase) and explain its relevance or 
connection to the main claim of the paragraph. It may 
take one sentence, it may take several. 
5) The Concluding Sentence: Thoreau’s choice of 
terminology to describe something results in the shifting of his 
attention and priorities. Like a conclusion paragraph, this 
final sentence summarizes the main take-away for the 
reader of that paragraph its located within. 
These parts of the paragraph should be present in any standard 
body paragraph, but besides the topic and concluding 
62  |  2B. READING ANALYSIS: SUMMARIZING, PARAPHRASING,
AND QUOTING
sentences, the other elements can actually be re-ordered 
(evidence can come before the main claim, if it’s clear which 
is which!). Use signal phrases and transitions to help guide the 
reader so they know the purpose of each of your sentences. 
 
A Note on Direct Quotes and 
Syntax 
Quotes (and this can be tricky!) have to be integrated 
into the correct syntax of your sentences, which may 
occasionally mean adding a word or clarifying a pronoun. 
Syntax refers to the ordering of words and expressions within 
a sentence.  Brackets [ ] are useful for maintaining a smooth 
flow in the syntax of a sentence while integrating a quotation. 
Brackets are a signal to the reader that you are inserting a word 
or phrase into into a quotation for the purposes of clarity and 
correct syntax. 
Example: Buell claims that “[Thoreau’s] point was not 
that we should turn our backs on nature but that we 
must imagine the ulterior benefits of the original turn to 
nature in the spirit of economy, both fiscal and ethical” 
(392). 
Pro Tip: Here is what happens to your reader’s attention and 
understanding of your argument when you don’t match a

direct quote’s syntax with the rest of the sentence that you’re 
placing it into:

sources and perspectives in your writing 
• Determine a question worth writing on 
• Develop strategies to narrow down your

Synthesis: Putting Together 
Different Perspectives

In college writing and in any situation where you have to sift 
through a lot of information, you will need to critically 
evaluate what is useful and relevant to you, as well as separate 
what is true from what is not true. When you have done 
extensive reading or research on a topic, you’ll need to present 
your research clearly and concisely to your readers so that they 
understand all sides or aspects of an issue. Synthesizing your 
sources into your writing allows you to: 
• demonstrate your knowledge of a topic or issue; 
• make sense of different perspectives and claims on a 
topic or issue; 
• present the most important claims or points from your 
sources; 
• put your sources into conversation with one another to 
give context for your point of view and come to new 
insights and questions; 
• and support your claim fully. 
 
“The scholar of the first age received into him the world 
around; brooded thereon; gave it the new arrangement of 
his own mind, and uttered it again. It came into him life; 
it went out from him truth. It came to him short-lived 
actions; it went out from him immortal thoughts. It came 
to him business; it went from him poetry.” 
~Ralph Waldo Emerson, The American Scholar 
68  |  3A. SYNTHESIZING MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES
 
What is synthesis? 
When you synthesize in your writing, you are building a 
relationship between different ideas or sources. Synthesis 
means that you: 
• bring together lots of information in a meaningful way 
• show connections between different things 
• come to new insights 
• draw intriguing conclusions 
• take in the world around you, and give back truth 
You synthesize multiple perspectives (including your own) in 
an essay, and you often synthesize two or more perspectives in 
a paragraph. Thus, synthesis is a creative and interpretive act. 
How you put together different perspectives and sources will 
not be the same as how another writer puts them together. 
 
“Make it work!” 
Any Project Runway fans? The show has an 
“unconventional challenge” segment, where the designers 
3A. SYNTHESIZING MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES  |  69
put together a dress from different and unusual sets of 
materials. For example, for one challenge, they had to put 
together a dress with materials from a hardware store and 
a flower shop. In the example below, the designers use 
different candies to create a dress:

Synthesis in writing is like winning the unconventional 
challenge, and your essay is the beautifully finished piece 
you create by synthesizing various sources to support your 
overall goal. When facing any writing challenge in college, 
you can use the skills of critical inquiry and synthesis to 
meet any deadline and remember Tim Gunn’s motto – 
“Make it work!” 
 
 
70  |  3A. SYNTHESIZING MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES
How do I synthesize? 
 
Synthesizing sources into your writing is a juggling act. First, 
you want to figure out what your paragraph is doing: Is it 
providing information to the reader about a topic? Is it 
developing support and evidence for a particular claim you are 
making? Is it presenting a counterargument? Is it helping you 
to respond to a counterargument? 
• If you are providing information to your reader, then 
multiple sources will help you to present a complete 
picture of the topic/issue to your reader by offering 
different perspectives on this topic/issue or by offering 
several expert sources that support a single perspective. 
• If you are developing support and evidence for a 
particular claim or point you are making, then your 
sources should build upon each other. Each one should 
further the point of the one previously made. 
• If you are using multiple sources to develop a 
counterargument, you can pit your sources against each 
other. Use one to help acknowledge an opposing 
viewpoint and use another to help develop your 
response to that viewpoint. 
It is important when you are writing several different voices 
3A. SYNTHESIZING MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES  |  71
into a single paragraph that your voice does not get lost in the 
mix. Remember, an essay is about presenting and supporting 
your claims and ideas. Each paragraph should always make 
clear where you fit into the conversation. 
See the next two pages for examples of synthesis 
paragraphs and a synthesis table. 
 
Synthesis: Example 
Paragraphs 
From: “What We Talk About 
When We Talk About Obesity” 
by Catherine Womack for The 
Conversation 
Does reframing the debate help fight obesity? Yes – in fact it’s 
necessary, says series lead author Christina Roberto in “Patchy 
progress 
on 
obesity 
prevention: 
emerging 
examples, 
entrenched barriers, and new thinking.” They suggest a variety 
of new or retooled strategies ranging from educating health 
care providers about the dangers of weight stigmatization to 
mobilizing citizens to demand policy changes to address 
obesity. Their key insights are locating problems of obesity in 
72  |  3A. SYNTHESIZING MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES
the interactions between individuals and their environments, 
and breaking the vicious cycle of unhealthy food environments 
that reinforce preferences for those foods. But reframing is just 
the first step in the process of reversing the trend of obesity. 
Researchers also have to ask the questions that health policy 
makers want to hear and act on, says food and health policy 
expert Kelly Brownell in a commentary, co-authored with 
Roberto. Historian of science Naomi Oreskes says that 
scientists tend to follow a supply-side model of information, 
assuming their results will somehow naturally reach those who 
need it. Brownell and Roberto underscore this error, and 
strongly advise obesity researchers to frame questions and 
convey results in ways that understandable and relevant to 
policy makers’ and the public. Otherwise their work will 
remain unheard and unused. 
 
From: “The Persistent Myth of 
the Narcissistic Millennial” by 
Brooke Lea Foster for The 
Atlantic 
            Whether it’s Time’s 2013 cover story “The Me, Me, Me 
Generation” or Jeffrey Kluger’s book The Narcissist Next 
Door: Understanding the Monster in Your Family, in Your 
3A. SYNTHESIZING MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES  |  73
Office, in Your Bed—in Your World, the same statistics are cited 
as proof of Millennial narcissism. In a 2008 study published 
in the Journal of Personality, San Diego State University 
psychology professor Jean Twenge found that narcissistic 
behaviors among college students studied over a 27-year period 
had increased significantly from the 1970s. A second study 
published in 2008 by the National Institutes of Health showed 
that 9.4 percent of 20- to 29-year-olds exhibit extreme 
narcissism, compared with 3.2 percent of those older than 65. 
But there’s a problem with all of this evidence: The data is 
unreliable. “It’s incredibly unfair to call Millennials 
narcissistic, or to say they’re more so than previous 
generations,” says Jeffrey Jensen Arnett, a professor of 
psychology at Clark University and author of Getting to 30: 
A Parent’s Guide to the Twentysomething Years. Arnett has 
devoted a significant amount of time and research to 
disproving the statistics that San Diego State’s Twenge 
has built a career on. He says that her assertion that 
narcissistic behaviors among young people have risen 30 
percent is flimsy, since she’s basing it around data collected 
from the 40-question Narcissistic Personality Inventory 
(NPI), the results of which leave quite a bit up for 
interpretation. For example, does agreement with statements 
like “I am assertive” or “I wish I were more assertive” measure 
narcissism, self-esteem, or leadership? 
 
74  |  3A. SYNTHESIZING MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES
From: “Working Out the Meaning 
of ‘Meaningful’ Work” by 
Katherine Moos for Vitae 
Adam Smith believed that work forces the worker to sacrifice 
“his tranquility, his freedom, and his happiness.” Karl Marx 
criticized Smith’s view and believed that labor in the form 
of creative problem solving could indeed provide “self-
realization.” (To Marx, the problem lay not in labor itself, 
but in the system of wage labor that exploited workers and 
alienated them from the creation of the final product.) A 
history of economic thought shows us that the progressive 
scorn nowadays of the do-what-you-love motto, is actually 
switching sides on a very old debate. Arguing that work is 
inherently unpleasant reinforces one of the more insidious 
assumptions in mainstream economics and one of the more 
cynical claims in our culture: that people are merely consumers 
trying to maximize their pleasure and minimize their pain. 
That sort of thinking leads managers to assume that workers 
are bound to shirk responsibility whenever possible, and are 
only motivated by money. It breeds extremely dysfunctional 
work environments with high surveillance and competition 
among co-workers. The polymath Herbert Simon has written 
about how workers’ sense of identification with the mission of 
an organization explains why employees actually perform the 
duties necessary to promote the institution’s goals, and not 
just pursue their self-interest as economic theory would expect.

3B. DEVELOPING 
QUESTIONS AT ISSUE 
Question at Issue (Q@I) 
The type of argument we practice at UO is known as ethical 
argumentation, 
or 
argumentation 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
inquiry. Inquiry is the act of asking questions, of investigating 
an issue or problem. We teach this type of argumentation at 
the college level because asking questions is exactly what you’re 
asked to do in your other classes; the modern American 
university is premised on the idea that its graduates will take 
the tools and knowledge they gain in their studies and go out 
into the world to help solve complex problems facing society. 
Therefore, we teach argumentative writing that 
attempts to answer a controversial or debatable question, 
which is known as a question at issue (or Q@I). A 
question is at issue when the audience is not in 
agreement about the answer, so the writer must offer 
a reasonable answer and support that answer with 
evidence. 
 
This is an example of a question 
that is NOT at Issue: 
Was the United States founded in 1776? 
This question is not at issue because there’s no reasonable 
debate about the answer. Reasonable people–from expert 
historians to the average person on the street–would agree that 
“yes” is the only valid answer to that question. An 
unreasonable person might want to debate that, but there’s 
not much point engaging in reasonable debate with an 
unreasonable person (though we’ve all had to do it 
occasionally). 
 
This is an example of a question 
that IS at issue on a similar 
topic: 
Did the founding of the US improve living conditions for most 
people living in the colonies? 
Even if you’re not a US historian, you can imagine that 
there might be some reasonable debate about the answer 
to this question. Some people might assume the answer is 
“yes,” some might assume the answer is “no,” while still others 
82  |  3B. DEVELOPING QUESTIONS AT ISSUE
could argue the more cautious position of “it depends.” But 
even those that agree that the answer is “it depends” might 
disagree on what the answer actually depends on. And 
importantly, there can be a reasonable debate on all of those 
positions backed up by evidence: tax records, first-hand 
accounts, information about slave auctions, etc. 
 
Understand the difference?

Finding good Q@Is is not always an easy task, and depends 
on your own critical and methodical reading, careful attention 
to class conversation, and consideration of your own 
assumptions and experiences in relation to the topic at hand. 
 
3B. DEVELOPING QUESTIONS AT ISSUE  |  83
You will know you’ve identified a 
good question at issue (Q@I) for 
your class when: 
1. Disagreement exists about the answer or possible 
answers to the Q@I. 
2. It’s an issue that the discourse community cares 
about (meaning that it’s related to class readings and 
discussions). 
3. You care about this issue and question. 
4. It’s specific enough to answer persuasively in the space 
allotted for the essay. 
5. The question calls for logical, evidence-based support, 
and stakeholders within the discourse community are 
capable of being reasonable about the issue. 
6. It’s the type of question you want to pose. 
 
In WR 121, Q@Is should be formulated as controversial, 
specific, yes/no questions. To generate yes/no questions 
(also known as “divided” responses), pay attention to the 
language used: 
• “Multiple response” questions tend to start with words 
like who, what, why, and how. These types of Q@Is will 
be covered in WR 122/123 because they often require 
84  |  3B. DEVELOPING QUESTIONS AT ISSUE
much longer answers, which translate to longer essays 
than what we require in WR 121. 
• “Divided response” questions use words like is, are, 
can, will, do, does, would, and should 
Yes no hands by cottonbro on Pexels. 
When considering whether or 
not your Q@I is arguable, 
consider the following: 
• Does the question demand a clear stance? Can your 
peers quickly take a stand one way or the other? 
• Is there reasonable disagreement about the answer to the 
question? Is it possible that your audience could be 
persuaded to agree to your answer to the question? 
• Does your question use debatable, specific words, like 
“best,” “worst,” “most,” “least,” or “better”? 
• Does your question at issue relate to the readings and 
3B. DEVELOPING QUESTIONS AT ISSUE  |  85
discussions of the class? 
 
Remember: While many questions will occur to you, 
identifying a question does not necessarily mean you’re 
identifying a Q@I. Which of the following questions are 
NOT effective Q@Is? 
Is college good for people to attend? 
• Not a question at issue. The use of “good” here makes 
the question much too vague and broad, so there can’t be 
reasonable, evidence-based debate on the answer to the 
question. 
Should universities pay foreign language teachers more so that 
we could see if it would increase the quality of foreign language 
education? 
• Not a question at issue. But this is a tricky one. The 
problem here is not one of specificity, but rather that it’s 
asking two questions, not one: (1) Should universities pay 
foreign language teachers more? AND (2) would paying 
foreign language teachers more increase the quality of the 
language education? In truth, either one of those questions 
alone would be a good starting point for a Q@I, but 
together they’re not focused enough to have a reasonable 
86  |  3B. DEVELOPING QUESTIONS AT ISSUE
debate in the space allotted for our essays. 
Would spending more time on grammar instruction in college 
writing courses produce college graduates with better writing 
skills? 
• This question is at issue. It’s debatable, specific, and 
answering it persuasively would require logic and 
evidence. It’s asking a type of question known as a 
“Question of Consequence.” Framing your question at issue 
as a type of stasis question can help you find a good 
question at issue more quickly. For more on Stasis Question 
Types, click “Next” below. 
Types of Questions at Issue: 
Stasis Questions 
How do you know a question is a 
good question? 
• Disagreement exists about the answer or possible 
answers to the question 
• It’s on an issue that the discourse community cares 
about (meaning that it’s related to class readings and 
discussions) 
• You care about this issue and question 
3B. DEVELOPING QUESTIONS AT ISSUE  |  87
• It’s specific enough to answer persuasively in the space 
allotted for the essay 
• The question calls for logical, evidence-based support, 
and stakeholders within the discourse community are 
capable of being reasonable about the issue 
• It’s the type of question you want to pose 
Stasis Questions are types of questions 
that can help you to find more specific, 
debatable Q@Is. 
Some stasis questions lead to better questions at issue than 
others. For example, questions of fact can be controversial 
(meaning that people debate the answer), but it depends on 
the subject. The concept of Stasis Theory was originally 
developed by the ancient Greek philosophers Aristotle and 
Hermagores and further enhanced by the contributions of 
Roman and many later rhetoricians. 
Stasis is hitting on that point in an issue where people will 
have different points of view. Have you found stasis with the 
question you want to write on? Ask yourself: 
◦ Is it provocative and arguable? 
◦ Is it framed as a yes/no question? 
◦ Is it specific enough to be answered persuasively 
(with the evidence available!) in an essay of at least 
88  |  3B. DEVELOPING QUESTIONS AT ISSUE
[insert minimum word count here]? 
In The Shape of Reason (1986), John Gage develops six types of 
stasis questions that are useful for creating your own questions 
at issue or identifying questions at issue (aka main ideas) in 
sources you are reading. Our definitions and examples of these 
questions are adapted from The Shape of Reason and the 
pamphlet Reading, Reasoning, and Writing (2015) by Jim 
Crosswhite. 
Knowing the type of Q@I you are asking is important. It 
tells you the kind of work you need to do in your essay and 
helps determine the argument you’ll need to make to answer 
it. For example, A question of policy (Should we ban smoking 
on campus?) requires a different argument than a question of 
consequence (Would banning smoking on campus reduce litter 
on campus?) 
 
Questions of Fact 
These depend on whether something is true, does exist, or 
has happened. In many cases, as with journalistic or scientific 
questions, proving these answers might only require looking 
something up in a textbook or other reliable source. As such, 
they tend not to be “at issue” as often. 
3B. DEVELOPING QUESTIONS AT ISSUE  |  89
Examples: Are there 24 hours in a day? Do bears hibernate? 
Image: Grizzly bear; Wikimedia Commons 
 
Questions of Definition 
These questions depend on the specific definition of a word or 
phrase. A definition might be as simple as looking something 
up in a dictionary, or comparing the meanings that differ 
between sources. 
Examples: Is flag-burning illegal? Can an exotic animal be a 
pet?

Questions of Interpretation 
These types of questions depend on how an author interprets 
a word or phrase that is not as simple as a dictionary definition. 
It might also seek an explanation of something’s significance. 
They often require authors to articulate or defend their point 
of view. 
Examples: Is Batman a true hero? Are mandatory minimum 
sentences necessary? 
3B. DEVELOPING QUESTIONS AT ISSUE  |  91

Questions of Value 
 
Value questions add shades of good/bad or right/wrong to 
a question of interpretation. In these cases, the positive or 
negative connotations of the language signal the underlying 
value. Questions of value and Questions of interpretation are 
very similar types of questions and often result in similar types 
of arguments. 
Examples: Are Disney movies sexist? Is it wrong to ban books?

3B. DEVELOPING QUESTIONS AT ISSUE  |  93
Questions of Consequence 
Questions like this deal with cause and effect: If X happens or 
is true, will Y follow as a result? The best examples of these 
questions avoid vague verbs like change, affect, and influence, 
and try to use descriptive or “directional” verbs that add 
information and make a debate more likely. 
Examples: Do anti-smoking campaigns discourage teens from 
trying cigarettes? Do gender-specific summer camps promote 
healthier self-images among young girls?

94  |  3B. DEVELOPING QUESTIONS AT ISSUE
Questions of Policy 
Policy questions occur when a discourse community might 
agree on every other aspect of a topic, but the question of 
“What should we do about it?” is the point that divides them. 
Examples: Should the government lower the legal drinking age? 
Should schools require students to say the Pledge of Allegiance?

Brainstorming 
1. Make a list of as many 
questions you can on an 
issue you want to address or 
your essay topic 
• What types of 
questions are you 
asking? What other 
types of questions are 
worth asking? 
2. Turn these into yes/no stasis questions: 
• What questions spark the most interesting debate to 
you?

Topic Development and 
Prewriting 
Learning Objectives 
• Deploy a range of prewriting strategies to 
choose a topic and narrow the focus of an 
essay. 
• Develop a working thesis statement to help 
you outline and draft an essay 
 
For most students (and their teachers), the most difficult part 
of any writing project is knowing where to begin and how to 
fill a blank page.  The other difficult part, sharing your work 
with other people who might criticize it, becomes much easier 
if you have a positive start to a project. When faced with a 
blank page, it is easy to be overwhelmed, shut off the screen, 
and procrastinate. Experienced writers do not wake up each 
day, start typing, and crank out page after page of perfect prose 
or poetry. They take their time, try to keep a schedule, and 
follow a common writing process while developing their own 
style. 
Just as you need a recipe, ingredients, and proper tools to cook 
a delicious meal, you also need a plan, resources, and adequate 
time to create effective academic essays, presentations, and 
other writing assignments. Writing is a process that works best 
when you follow steps and use time-tested strategies to 
accomplish your goals and meet the rigorous expectations of 
your professors. Chefs, surgeons, architects, musicians, and 
athletes do not become professionals overnight; they practice 
and practice their craft until they become technicians and 
artists. 
 
Prewriting Techniques 
In addition to composing Questions at Issue, a strategy 
3C. FROM CURIOSITY TO INQUIRY  |  99
explored elsewhere in Chapter 3, academic writers use a variety 
of prewriting techniques to develop a topic and begin their 
writing projects.  These include: 
• Task Analysis 
• Freewriting 
• Idea mapping 
• Journalist’s questions (5WH) 
• Web browsing 
If you take the time prewrite while developing your topic, you 
will feel more prepared to develop a working thesis for your 
essay and begin outlining and drafting. 
Using the strategies in this section can help you begin filling 
any blank page or screen with your ideas and evidence and 
confidently begin the writing process. As you try out the 
various prewriting strategies in this chapter and begin to draft, 
revise, and edit your essays, the following topic checklist can 
help you decide if your working thesis is narrow and focused 
enough for your assignment: 
• How can I develop curiosity and interest about an 
assigned topic? 
• How can my curiosity and reading help me develop my 
own topic? 
• Will my topic suit the purpose and audience for my 
writing task? 
100  |  3C. FROM CURIOSITY TO INQUIRY
• What do I already know about the topic? Is my personal 
experience related to the topic or task? 
• What more do I want to learn about this topic and 
where I can I learn more about it? 
• Do other writers disagree about this topic or have 
different perspectives than mine? 
• Is my topic focused and specific enough to fit the length 
requirements of the writing task? 
 
Task Analysis 
Many writing topics in college and the workplace are assigned 
as tasks. You may be tasked with answering a question written 
by your instructor or required to come up with your own 
topic for an essay with relatively little guidance.  When starting 
any writing processes, being with a task analysis. Read and 
analyze the task instructions both closely and critically, from 
the purpose and scope of the task to details about topic, 
length, deadlines, style, sources, and other requirements. 
 
Writing assignments can vary widely by subject and instructor 
in college so you may have to ask follow-up questions in class, 
by email, or during office hours to make sure you understand 
the expectations of the task.  Just as some college writing 
3C. FROM CURIOSITY TO INQUIRY  |  101
begins with an assigned topic, professors and professional 
writers typically begin new writing projects based on topic 
suggestions from editors. When given the opportunity to 
develop your own topic, the following strategies can also be 
helpful: 
• Consider whether you can identify the purpose of the 
writing task and your audience 
• Reflect on what you already know about the topic and 
any personal experiences with it 
• Read the task guidelines critically and sympathetically 
and ask questions about the expectations 
• Annotate the task guidelines and highlight key words or 
information you need to remember 
 
Freewriting 
Freewriting is an exercise in which you handwrite or type 
without stopping for a set amount of time. During a freewrite, 
your goal is to fill the page with writing as quickly as possible 
without worrying about spelling, sentence structure, or 
punctuation. If you get stuck, you can copy the same word 
over and over again, insert tangents, and generally do all you 
can to stay focused on the task – whether you are 
brainstorming a topic from scratch or developing ideas for an 
102  |  3C. FROM CURIOSITY TO INQUIRY
assigned topic. You can write in full sentences, bullet points, 
rhyming couplets, or whatever strikes your fancy as you let 
your mind wander and write down all words that you can 
think of about your topic. You might try entering these words 
into a wordcloud generator (for example, Wordclouds or 
Wordart) to look for patterns that emerge or discover that you 
have a strong set of keywords to type into library and internet 
search engines. 
 
Freewriting exercises the muscles we use to produce writing, 
which makes it easier on our bodies to sit down and compose 
paragraphs and pages of text required for essays.  If you can 
find a comfortable space to do your freewriting, you can relax 
and put away distractions like phones and social media. Try 
to write without doubting your ideas or worrying whether or 
not they make sense to someone else. Your flow of thoughts 
may lead you to unexpected or even uncomfortable places, but 
the exercise will definitely pay off later as you reflect, read, and 
further develop your topic. 
 
Idea Mapping 
Idea mapping is a form of brainstorming that turns the space 
of the page into a visual canvas. One way to brainstorm visually 
3C. FROM CURIOSITY TO INQUIRY  |  103
is to use your writing and art skills to fill the page with a visual 
interpretation of your topic or concept.  Graphic novelists, 
advertisers, and web designers are just a few of the people 
whose work requires the ability to combine text and images 
on the page.  If you are a visual learner or nonlinear thinker, 
sometimes starting in your comfort zone as you develop a topic 
or concept can help you prepare for the structured work of 
developing an outline for a formal academic essay. 
 
Idea mapping is a structured brainstorming exercise that 
allows you to visualize your ideas and develop connections 
between keywords using circles, lines, and arrows.  This 
technique is also known as “clustering” because the ideas 
become clustered across the page and grouped together using 
lines and arrows. Many writers use larger and smaller circles 
to signify the scope or importance of certain words and help 
narrow a topic. Using idea mapping, you might discover 
interesting connections between topics that you had not 
thought of before. 
 
To create an idea map, start with a blank sheet of paper and 
write or draw your main topic in the center and draw a circle 
or other shape around it. Use lines or arrows to connect ideas 
and keywords as you fill the space of the page. Create clusters 
of keywords and ideas across the page as your ideas emerge. 
104  |  3C. FROM CURIOSITY TO INQUIRY
Idea mapping is a great excuse to get some markers, crayons, or 
anything that helps you think visually and use large sheets of 
paper. Use a camera to snap a record of your work to review 
later. You can also create idea maps on using slideshow 
software or other publication applications. 
 
Figure 1: Idea Map 
 
Journalist’s Questions (5WH) 
Before narrowing a topic all the way down to a single question 
3C. FROM CURIOSITY TO INQUIRY  |  105
at issue that can be answered in a thesis statement, a general 
topic or concept can be effectively narrowed down and focused 
by applying the six journalist’s questions: 
• Who? 
• What? 
• When? 
• Where? 
• Why? 
• How? 
 
Also know as 5WH, these six questions are a great place to 
start because they will inevitably lead you to asking secondary 
questions about how you can locate information in books, 
articles and other sources.  If the sources for an essay have 
been assigned to you (such a course textbook or set of shared 
readings), the journalist’s questions can help you read those 
texts sympathetically and critically to gather information and 
direct quotations that can be used to provide supporting 
evidence in your essays. 
 
Web Browsing 
For thousands of years, students and scholars had to go to a 
106  |  3C. FROM CURIOSITY TO INQUIRY
library, archive, or bookstore to browse encyclopedias, books, 
academic journals, magazines, government documents, and 
other kinds of source material to analyze and use as evidence 
in their essays.  Developed by computer scientists, the military, 
and universities during the second half of the 20th century, 
the internet became widely available for use schools, libraries, 
and homes during the 1990s.  Since then, students and their 
professors have been using web browsers, search engines, and 
online databases to brainstorm topics, read articles, and 
conduct research. 
 
Your university library website is a great resource for topic 
development because librarians are highly trained to provide 
students and researchers access to information.  Information 
literacy is the ability to find, identify, evaluate, and use 
information effectively.  Librarians trained in information 
literacy pass on those skills by developing research guides and 
other materials that will be useful guides on your journey. 
Librarians these days are very welcoming people who are 
happy to chat about your writing at any stage in the process. 
Your library website may also have a web page with tips on how 
to get the most out of your browsing experience. 
 
As you browse, look for three types of useful sources to 
3C. FROM CURIOSITY TO INQUIRY  |  107
develop a broad perspective of your topic: primary, secondary, 
and tertiary. 
 
Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary 
Sources 
When searching for information on a topic, it is important 
to understand the value of primary, secondary, and tertiary 
sources. 
 
Primary sources allow researchers to get as close as possible 
to original ideas, events, and empirical research as possible. 
Such sources may include creative works, first-hand or 
contemporary accounts of events, and the publication of the 
results of empirical observations or research. 
 
Secondary 
sources 
analyze, 
review, 
or 
summarize 
information in primary resources or other secondary resources. 
Even sources presenting facts or descriptions about events are 
secondary unless they are based on direct participation or 
observation. Moreover, secondary sources often rely on other 
secondary sources and standard disciplinary methods to reach 
108  |  3C. FROM CURIOSITY TO INQUIRY
results, and they provide the principal sources of analysis about
primary sources. 
 
Tertiary sources provide overviews of topics by synthesizing 
information gathered from other resources. Tertiary resources 
often provide data in a convenient form or provide 
information with context by which to interpret it. 
 
The distinctions between primary, secondary, and tertiary 
sources can sometimes be ambiguous. An individual 
document may be a primary source in one context and a 
secondary source in another. While these definitions are clear, 
the lines can begin to blur in the different discipline areas. 
Sources in the humanities and social 
sciences 
In the humanities and social sciences, primary sources are the 
direct evidence or first-hand accounts of events without 
secondary analysis or interpretation. In contrast, secondary 
sources analyze or interpret historical events or creative works. 
 
3C. FROM CURIOSITY TO INQUIRY  |  109
Primary sources 
Secondary sources 
Tertiary sources 
A primary source 
is an original
document 
containing 
firsthand 
information 
about a topic. 
Different fields of 
study may use 
different types of 
primary sources, 
such as diaries, 
interviews, letters, 
original works of 
art, photographs, 
speeches, or 
works of 
literature. 
A secondary source 
contains 
commentary on or 
discussion about a 
primary source. The 
most important 
feature of secondary 
sources is that they 
offer an 
interpretation of 
information 
gathered from 
primary sources: 
biographies, 
dissertations, 
indexes, abstracts, 
journals, articles, or 
monographs. 
A tertiary source 
presents summaries 
or condensed 
versions of materials, 
usually with 
references back to the 
primary and/or 
secondary sources. 
They can be a good 
place to look up facts 
or get a general 
overview of a subject, 
but they rarely 
contain original 
material: dictionaries, 
encyclopedias, or 
handbooks.

Sources in the sciences 
In the sciences, primary sources are documents that provide 
full descriptions of the original research. For example, a 
primary source would be a journal article where scientists 
describe their research on the genetics of tobacco plants. A 
secondary source would be an article commenting on or 
analyzing the scientists’ research on tobacco. 
 
Primary sources 
Secondary sources 
Tertiary sources 
These are where 
the results of 
original research 
are usually first 
published in the 
sciences. This 
makes them the 
best source of 
information on 
cutting-edge 
topics. This 
includes 
conference 
proceedings, 
interviews, 
journals, lab 
notebooks, 
patents, 
preprints, 
technical reports, 
or theses and 
dissertations. 
These tend to 
summarize the 
existing state of 
knowledge in a field 
at the time of 
publication. 
Secondary sources 
are good to find 
comparisons of 
different ideas and 
theories and to see 
how they may have 
changed over time: 
books, reviews, 
textbooks, or 
treatises. 
These types of 
sources present 
condensed material, 
generally with 
references back to the 
primary and/or 
secondary literature. 
They can be a good 
place to look up data 
or to get an overview 
of a subject, but they 
rarely contain 
original material. 
Tertiary sources 
include compilations, 
dictionaries, 
encyclopedias, 
handbooks, or 
tables.

Developing a Working Thesis 
A writer’s thesis statement–the main point, idea, or 
argument–will typically change and develop throughout the 
writing process.  Sometimes, you will feel such passion about 
topic or have such a clear understanding of the purpose of 
a writing assignment that a thesis can spring to mind quite 
early in the process.  At other times, the most concise and 
expressive version of the main idea of an essay does not reveal 
itself until you have drafted the essay and revised it several 
times.  Before developing a formal outline or composing the 
112  |  3C. FROM CURIOSITY TO INQUIRY
first draft of an academic essay, write out your working thesis
will help you stay focused on your main point or controlling 
ideas as you compose the paragraphs of your first draft.  Keep 
in mind that your thesis is quite likely to evolve during the 
writing process. A working (or preliminary) thesis should be a 
one or two sentence statement of your perspective, position, or 
opinion of a topic.

116  |  CHAPTER FOUR: COMPOSING ACADEMIC ESSAYS
4A. OUTLINING 
Outlining is a focused prewriting and visualization technique 
that helps writers organize their ideas for an essay to meet 
a word count requirement, to decide which evidence and 
appeals will best suit their purpose and audience, and keep 
arguments and counterarguments focused on the main idea. 
Drafting is the step in the writing process at which you 
compose a complete first version of an academic essay or other 
piece of writing. Organizing your ideas for an essay into a 
formal or informal outline will help you translate your raw 
insights and research into a form that will communicate 
meaning to a reader. It will also provide you with a guide to 
follow in that moment when you reach the end of a paragraph 
and need to transition to a new one. Used in combination, 
outlining and drafting are powerful tools that can writers use 
to organize their ideas, previsualize their finished piece of 
writing, and manage their time effectively as the clock ticks 
down toward your deadlines. 
 
Planning Ahead 
When tasked with composing an essay, giving a presentation, 
or writing an application letter, you need to develop your ideas 
in an order that makes sense to your audience and suits the 
purpose of the task. Order refers to your choice of what to 
present first, second, third, and so on in your writing – from 
the order of individual words in a sentence to the order of 
sentences in paragraphs and paragraphs in an essay. Outlining 
provides writers the ability to play around with the order of 
ideas, evidence, paragraphs, and other elements of an essay 
before committing them to the page. A formal outline is a 
detailed guide that shows how all of your supporting ideas 
relate to each other and to your thesis. It helps you distinguish 
between ideas and details that are of relatively equal 
importance from ones of lesser or supporting importance. An 
outline is a useful framework for crafting your first draft. 
Cognitively, outlining also stimulates the brain to begin 
previsualizing a finished composition. With practice, a writer 
can use an outline (or even a detailed task analysis, freewrite, or 
idea map) to think spatially and temporally about the writing 
process. Thinking spatially involves a writer’s ability to picture 
how the essay will take physical shape on the page as their 
thoughts flow from their fingertips through the pen or 
keyboard and become words, sentences, paragraphs, and even 
chapters. Temporal thinking involves a writer’s ability to 
118  |  4A. OUTLINING
conceptualize and schedule the hours, days, or even months 
that will be required to draft, revise, and edit any essay or 
writing task. While writers are always making spatial and 
temporal decisions internally while planning and drafting an 
essay, an outline can provide you a concrete representation of 
your planning and a guide to follow while writing your first 
draft. 
As writers consider the purpose and goals for a writing task, 
they often begin by prewriting to reflect on the best way to 
order their ideas, appeals, and evidence. Poets, journalists, and 
essayists and other writers typically balance order and purpose 
in their writing by considering three ways of organizing: 
• Order of Importance 
• Chronological Order 
• Spatial Order 
 
4A. OUTLINING  |  119
Order 
Purpose 
Order of 
Importance 
• To persuade or convince 
• To rank or evaluate items or issues by the 
value or significance 
Chronological 
Order 
• To explain the history of an event or 
topic 
• To narrate a story or share an anecdote 
• To explain the steps in a process of 
making, doing, or thinking 
Spatial Order 
• To help readers visualize a person, place, 
or event as you see it 
• To describe sensory examples: sight, 
smell, sound, taste, touch 
 
Academic essays typically deploy Order of Importance 
strategies. Once you have written out our working thesis, you 
are ready to develop a formal outline for an academic essay. 
There are many strategies and methods for outlining an essay. 
Typically, a formal outline uses numbers and letters or bullet 
points to format the page. 
120  |  4A. OUTLINING
A formal outline for an academic essay will typically look 
something like the following example. An outline like this one 
can help you make sure that your essays develop your own 
voice as a writer and use your sources for support, rather than 
letting your sources dominate the essay.  Distinguished 
Professor of Writing Lisa Ede once said, “let your writing tell 
you what to read.” Creating even a skeletal outline for an essay 
or writing project allows you to follow that advice and 
confidently develop your voice while reading, researching, and 
drafting. 
• Introduction 
◦ Lure/Hook 
◦ Topic Context 
▪ Question at issue 
◦ Thesis 
◦ Preview of main ideas (useful for essays that are 
longer than five paragraphs) 
 
• Background and Context 
◦ Depending on the length and content 
requirements of an essay assignment, it may be 
useful to include a background and context 
4A. OUTLINING  |  121
paragraph to define keywords, provide background 
information or historical context, or situate your 
approach to a topic in relation to a particular 
audience or discourse community. 
• Supporting Arguments 
As many as needed to develop your thesis and meet your 
word count. 
◦ Topic Sentence 
◦ Reasoning 
◦ Evidence 
▪ Signal Phrase 
▪ Quotation or Paraphrase 
▪ Explanation 
◦ Analysis 
◦ Transition 
• Alternative/Opposing Arguments 
As needed to develop your thesis 
◦ Topic Sentence: Assertion about your thesis from 
an alternative perspective 
◦ Reasoning 
◦ Evidence 
◦ Analysis and refutation (if needed) of the 
alternative reasoning 
122  |  4A. OUTLINING
◦ Transition 
 
• Synthesis 
◦ Synthesis paragraphs reflect on the relationship 
between the supporting and alternative arguments 
and consider the possibilities for reaching common 
ground on the issue 
• Conclusion 
◦ Reiterate your main idea and summarize how you 
arrived at your thesis 
◦ Consider the broader implication and/or 
limitations of your reasoning and evidence 
◦ Circle the reader back to your opening sentences to 
bring them full circle 
• References 
◦ Citation styles vary by academic discipline and 
instructor preference. Humanities scholars 
generally use MLA, social science and science 
scholars generally use APA, and styles like Chicago 
and Harvard are used in a variety of academic 
4A. OUTLINING  |  123
disciplines 
124  |  4A. OUTLINING
4B. DRAFTING 
Drafting is the point in the writing process at which you 
compose a complete first version of an essay. There are as many 
ways to write a first draft as there are essays in the world. Some 
academic writers begin their drafts with body paragraphs and 
work backwards to their introduction while others feel the 
need to develop a solid introduction before launching into the 
body of the essay.  The best advice offered by most professional 
writers is to try not to worry too much about how unprepared, 
disorganized, repetitive, or uninspired a first draft might feel 
because relatively few of us can sit down and compose an entire 
essay (or even email) that is ready to be published in a single 
draft.  As students, it can be easy to overlook the fact that 
the books and articles we read for class have been revised and 
edited many times and with the support of many people prior 
to publication. Your instructors will expect you to perform 
the role of both writer and editor before turning in your final 
draft. 
As you dive into the drafting stage of the writing process, the 
following advice may come in handy when you are facing the 
pressure of deadlines and grades: 
 
• Begin with the part of your essay 
you know the most about or feel 
least nervous about. 
◦ Having an outline allows you to start with the 
third, fifth, or second paragraph of an essay 
without worrying how it will flow with the rest. 
Your initial paragraphs may vary in length or 
contain insufficient reasoning or evidence as you 
draft. Topic sentences, transitions, and other details 
can be cleaned up later. Be sure to cite sources even 
if you’re unsure what quotation or other evidence 
you might include to reduce your formatting time 
later (and help you avoid unintentional plagiarism). 
• Just do it! 
◦ Hesitation can be a writer’s worst enemy. Facing a 
blank page can feel like a climbing to the top of a 
diving platform and being too wary to jump or 
being unable to choose a restaurant for dinner. 
Although every good writer should be self-critical 
at times, try to remember that a first draft can be 
terrible and still be very useful. Try not to look back 
or doubt your ideas – there will be time for that 
later. Treat your drafting sessions like freewriting 
and do not worry about transitions, spelling, 
126  |  4B. DRAFTING
punctuation, and other mechanics. 
• Leave yourself a short note or 
comment at the end of each 
writing session. 
◦ Every writer has picked up something they wrote a 
day or week ago and wondered what the heck they 
were thinking. Take an extra minute at the end of a 
writing session to leave yourself a short note or 
comment to remind yourself where you hope to 
pick up or anything you need to look up. Notes 
and comments can also be useful if you feel a 
sentence in your paragraph may be tangential or 
incomplete and you want to come back to it later. 
• Pace yourself and take breaks. 
◦ Essays take time to develop. Hopefully, you can 
find a place to write where you are comfortable and 
able to avoid distractions. Turn off your phone and 
try not to have an internet browser open unless 
citing evidence. 
• Be reasonable with your goals. 
◦ Begin each writing session by taking a moment to 
4B. DRAFTING  |  127
consider how long you plan to write and what you 
hope to accomplish. Plan breaks to stretch and 
rehydrate. Holding yourself to a goal for each 
session will help you stay on track toward your 
deadlines and give you a sense of achievement. 
Rewarding yourself after each successful writing 
session can be useful motivation as well. 
• Keep your audience, purpose, 
and task requirements in mind. 
◦ By the time we get several paragraphs or hours into 
a writing task, we can become so attached to our 
own ideas and writing style that we lose track of 
our audience and purpose. Asking yourself “who 
will be reading this essay?” and “how will it be 
assessed?” or “what is my overall purpose?” can 
help you keep an eye on the big picture. Checking 
assignment guidelines will help guide your work 
and help you ensure that your draft meets an 
instructor or editor’s expectations. 
 
The Value of First Drafts 
A first draft is a complete version of a piece of writing, but 
128  |  4B. DRAFTING
it is certainly not expected to be the final version. During the 
revision stage, you will have the opportunity to make all kinds 
of changes to your first draft before you put the final touches 
on it during the editing stage. A first draft gives you a complete 
working version of an essay that is ready to share with peers, 
writing coaches, instructors, and/or editors that can be 
improved with revision and editing. 
4B. DRAFTING  |  129
4C. BODY PARAGRAPHS 
Body paragraphs present the reasoning and evidence to 
demonstrate your thesis. In academic essays, body paragraphs 
are typically a bit more substantial than in news reporting so a 
writer can share their own ideas, develop their reasoning, cite 
evidence, and engage in conversation with other writers and 
scholars. A typical body paragraph in a college essay contains 
the following elements, which can be remembered through the 
useful acronym TREAT. 
The TREAT Method 
• Topic Sentence – an assertion that supports the thesis 
and presents the main idea of the paragraph 
• Reasoning – critical thinking and rhetorical appeals: 
ethos, logos, and pathos 
• Evidence – facts, examples, and other evidence 
integrated into the paragraph using summaries, 
paraphrases, and quotations 
• Analysis – examination and contextualization of the 
evidence and reasoning 
• Transition – the flow of ideas from one paragraph to the 
next 
 
Effective body paragraphs are: 
• Specific and narrow. Topic sentences provide your 
audience a point of transition and flow from paragraph 
to paragraph. Topic sentences help you expand and 
develop your thesis and set up the organization of each 
paragraph. Developing specific reasoning and specific, 
concrete examples and evidence in each paragraph will 
build your credibility with readers. If used properly, well-
developed reasoning and evidence are more compelling 
than general facts and observations. 
 
• Relevant to the thesis. Primary support is considered 
strong when it relates directly to the thesis. Body 
paragraphs should show, explain, and prove your thesis 
without delving into irrelevant details. With practice and 
the understanding that there is always another essay, 
effective writers resist the temptation to lose focus. 
Keeping your audience and purpose in mind when 
choosing examples will help you make sure to stay 
focused on your thesis. 
 
4C. BODY PARAGRAPHS  |  131
• Detailed. Academic paragraphs are typically longer than 
newspaper and magazine paragraphs because scholars 
need space to develop their reasoning and provide 
sufficiently detailed evidence to support their claims. 
Using multiple examples and precise details shows 
readers that you have considered the facts carefully and 
enhances the impact of your ideas. 
 
• Organized. If your paragraph starts to include 
information or ideas that stray from your topic sentence, 
either the paragraph or the topic sentence might need to 
change. 
 
Reasoning and Evidence 
In written and oral communication, we demonstrate our 
critical thinking skills through the various types of rhetorical 
appeals we make to our audience.  The purpose and audience 
for a writing task shape the way writers develop reasoning and 
select evidence to support their ideas.  Writers develop 
reasoning in body paragraphs through three primary methods: 
ethos, logos, and pathos.  Writers can deploy many forms of 
132  |  4C. BODY PARAGRAPHS
evidence to support their reasoning, including: facts, examples, 
judgments, testimony, and personal experience. 
Reasoning 
The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle developed a simple 
method for categorizing forms of reasoning by identifying 
three primary modes of argumentative reasoning: ethos, logos, 
and pathos. 
• Ethos is reasoning that establishes a writer’s credibility. 
By showing yourself to be a critical and sympathetic 
reader, who considers multiple perspectives and 
demonstrates ethical thinking, you can establish ethos in 
your body paragraphs. 
 
• Logos is reasoning that develops logical arguments and 
demonstrates a writer’s command of the facts. 
Demonstrating your knowledge of the facts and showing 
that you can distinguish between competing claims at 
truth will ground your writing in common sense and 
objectivity. 
 
4C. BODY PARAGRAPHS  |  133
• Pathos is reasoning that appeals to human emotions and 
psychological motivations. Humans are subjective 
animals, and our ability to develop an emotional 
connection with an audience can have a powerful or 
subtle impact on whether they will agree with a writer’s 
reasoning. 
A fourth form of reasoning, kairos, can occasionally be used 
to make an appeal to an audience that the perfect moment 
or right opportunity has arisen for action. Arguments for 
changing policies, ending wars, starting revolutions, or 
engaging in radical social change typically deploy kairos in 
addition to ethos, logos, and pathos in order to motivate 
people to take action a critical times in history. 
 
Evidence 
Evidence includes anything that can help you support your 
reasoning and develop your thesis. As you develop body 
paragraphs, you reveal evidence to your readers and then 
provide analysis to help the reader understand how the 
evidence supports the reasoning and assertions you are making 
in each body paragraph.  Be sure to check with each instructor 
to confirm what types of evidence are appropriate for each 
writing task you are assigned. The following kinds of evidence 
are commonly used in academic essays: 
134  |  4C. BODY PARAGRAPHS
• Facts. Facts are the best kind of evidence to use for 
academic essays because they often cannot be disputed 
or distorted. Facts can support your stance by providing 
background information or a solid evidence-based 
foundation for your point of view. Remember that facts 
need explanations. Be sure to use signal phrases like 
“according to” and “as demonstrated by” to introduce 
facts and use analysis to explain the relevance of facts to 
your readers. 
 
• Examples show readers that your ideas are grounded in 
real situations and contexts. Examples help you highlight 
general trends and ground your facts in the real world. 
Be careful not to take examples out of context or 
overgeneralize based on individual cases. 
 
• Judgments. Judgments are the conclusions of experts 
drawn from a set of examples or evidence. Judgments are 
more credible than opinions because they are founded 
upon careful reasoning and a thorough examination of a 
topic. Citing a credible expert to support your opinion 
can be a powerful way to build ethos in your writing. 
4C. BODY PARAGRAPHS  |  135
 
• Testimony. Testimony consists of direct quotations 
from eyewitnesses or expert witnesses. An eyewitness is 
someone who has direct experience with a subject; they 
add authenticity and credibility to an argument or 
perspective based on facts. An expert witness is a person 
who has extensive expertise or experience with a topic. 
This person provides commentary based on their 
interpretation of the facts or extensive knowledge on a 
topic or event. 
 
• Personal Experience. Personal observation is similar to 
eyewitness or expert testimony but consists of your own 
experiences and/or expertise. Personal experience can be 
effective in academic essays if directly relevant to the 
topic and suited to the purpose of a writing task. 
136  |  4C. BODY PARAGRAPHS
Key Takeaways 
• Always be aware of your purpose for writing 
and the needs of your audience. Cater to 
those needs in every sensible way. 
• Write paragraphs of an appropriate length for 
your writing assignment. Paragraphs in 
college-level writing can be up to a page long, 
as long as they cover the main topics in your 
outline. 
• Use your prewriting and outline to guide the 
development of your paragraphs and the 
elaboration of your ideas.

Addressing 
Counterarguments and 
Different Perspectives 
“Few things are more difficult than to see outside the 
bounds of your own perspective—to be able to identify 
assumptions that you take as universal truths but which, 
instead, have been crafted by your own unique identity 
and experiences in the world.” 
~David Takacs 
 
Why acknowledge and respond 
to other points of view? 
• Address potential weaknesses in your argument before 
others can point them out to you. 
• Acknowledge the complexity of an issue by considering 
different perspectives and aspects of an issue. No issue 
has a simple solution or is just Side A versus Side B. 
• Establish your writing ethos (can your reader trust 
you?): your reader is more likely to trust you if you 
138  |  4C. BODY PARAGRAPHS
thoughtfully analyze an issue from multiple angles. 
• Add to your essay’s word count! 
 
Four steps to acknowledging 
and responding to other points 
of view 
Step One: Know your standpoint 
What is my standpoint and why should I 
know it? 
• Standpoint is the unique perspective from which you 
view the world. It includes: your background and 
experiences, your political and religious beliefs, your 
identity (gender, ethnicity, class, sexuality, and ability), 
your relationship to others, and your social privilege. 
These are things that will affect how you view and 
understand an issue. 
• It’s important to acknowledge your standpoint because 
it affects what and how you argue. 
 
Good writers are good readers! And good readers. . . 
4C. BODY PARAGRAPHS  |  139
 
 
• Who are you? 
• Make a list of what 
you’ll bring to a 
conversation about the 
issue on which you’re 
writing. What are your 
assumptions, your 
background and 
experience, your 
knowledge and expertise? Be honest! 
 
 
 
Consider writing your standpoint into your 
essay 
• Writing your standpoint into your essay builds trust 
with your readers. Even if they have a different 
standpoint, they will respect your honesty and hopefully 
listen respectfully to what you have to say. 
140  |  4C. BODY PARAGRAPHS
• Writing from your standpoint can make your writing 
feel more authentic, to you and your reader. “This is 
me!” 
Even if you don’t explicitly reveal your standpoint to your 
reader, you’ll want to know your standpoint so that you are 
aware of your own implicit bias as you write. 
How do I write in my standpoint? Can I use 
“I”? 
Try one of these templates: 
◦ “What concerns me as a business major. . .” 
◦ “I write this essay during a time when. . .” 
◦ “I am concerned about. . .” 
See how other writers we’ve read have done it: 
◦ “Now, as a professor at the Harvard Graduate 
School of Education, I. . .” [From Anthony 
Abraham Jack, “I Was a Low-Income College 
Student. Classes Weren’t the Hard Part.” The New 
York Times Magazine] 
◦ “From my first day as a sociology professor at a 
university with a Division I football and men’s 
basketball team, education and athletics struck me 
as being inherently at odds. . .” [From Jasmine 
4C. BODY PARAGRAPHS  |  141
Harris, “It’s Naive to Think College Athletes Have 
Time for School,” The Conversation] 
◦ “In this society, that norm is usually defined as 
white, thin, male, young, heterosexual, Christian, 
and financially secure. It is within this mythical 
norm that the trappings of power reside. Those of us 
who stand outside that power, for any reason, often 
identify one way in which we are different, and we 
assume that quality to be the primary reason for all 
oppression. . .” [From Audre Lorde, “The 
Transformation of Silence into Language and 
Action”] 
◦ “I might not carry with me the feeling of my 
audience in stating my own belief. . .” [From Ralph 
Waldo Emerson, “The American Scholar”] 
 
Step Two: Consider potential 
weaknesses in your argument and 
different points of view on the issue 
What potential weaknesses in your 
argument might you address? 
• Logic: would a reader question any of your 
assumptions? 
142  |  4C. BODY PARAGRAPHS
◦ between your reasoning and your claim: your main 
unstated assumption 
◦ or between your evidence and your reasoning: is 
there evidence or types of evidence a reader might 
be skeptical of? 
• Does the reader hold false assumptions about the issue? 
• Could a reader give a different explanation of the 
issue? 
• Could a reader draw a different conclusion from the 
evidence? 
• Is there a specific reader who would disagree? 
 
What alternative points of view on the 
issue might you consider? 
• How might someone think differently about the issue? 
• How might someone approach the issue from a different 
standpoint? 
• What might keep someone from trusting or believing a 
claim or point you make? 
• What might make someone tentative about taking 
action? 
• What might keep a person from having an open mind? 
Which one should I choose to address? 
4C. BODY PARAGRAPHS  |  143
 
It depends on the essay’s length. You might consider 1-2 
counterarguments that are most important for you to 
address in a paper (depending on the length). 
• this could be a view your audience/community is likely 
to hold themselves 
• or a common-knowledge one you think everyone will 
think of while reading 
• and of course the one that is most specific to your 
argument 
• if you can get one that fits more than one of these 
criteria, that’s even better!

What NOT to do when considering a 
counterargument 
Build a straw man counterargument 
• A straw man argument is a logical fallacy where the 
writer misrepresents or oversimplifies someone else’s 
argument in order to make it easier to refute. 
• Writers also create straw man arguments when they 
make up a potential counterargument that is easy to 
refute, but isn’t something most people would 
reasonably believe. 
4C. BODY PARAGRAPHS  |  145
 
Step Three: It’s time to write your 
counterargument into your essay 
An exemplary counterargument: 
• exists as its own paragraph 
• you fully acknowledge and respond to it 
◦ Note: You don’t have to refute a counterargument 
for your argument to work. Our world is big 
enough to hold multiple points of view. The 
paragraph should ultimately support your thesis, 
but you may amend, qualify, complicate, or open 
up your claim, which is often why, organizationally, 
discussion of counterarguments or different points 
of view work best in the introduction of your essay 
to set up your claim or as the last body paragraph 
to lead into your conclusion. 
• relates to your audience/community’s likely concerns 
and interests 
• seems like a realistic thing someone might think (is not a 
straw man or caricature) 
• ideally, is specific to your argument, not your topic in 
general 
146  |  4C. BODY PARAGRAPHS
• considers both sides respectfully 
• may be more than one counterargument or different 
perspective, but you’d need a separate paragraph for each 
in order to give them full consideration 
 
Addressing 
a 
counterargument 
versus 
a 
different 
perspective 
A true counterargument is the opposing claim on an issue: 
▪ Claim: Academic probation does not help 
students progress. 
▪ Counterargument: Academic probation does 
help students progress. 
Different perspectives might offer different reasoning, 
consider different factors or conditions, or ask about different 
groups of people or situations. 
A counterargument needs to be rebutted. Different 
perspectives can help you amend, qualify, complicate, or 
open up your claim. 
You might use a counterargument to qualify your thesis 
An example: 
4C. BODY PARAGRAPHS  |  147
Reasoned thesis: Hook-up culture is now at the center 
of the institution of higher education because it is thick, 
palpable, the air students breathe, and we find it on 
almost every residential campus in America. [From Lisa 
Wade, “Sociology and the New Culture of Hooking Up 
on College Campuses“] 
A counterargument: Research findings suggest that 
the sexual practices of college students haven’t changed 
much since the 1980s. [From David Ludden, “Is Hook-
Up Culture Dominating College Campuses?”] 
Qualified claim: Although sexual practices of college 
students haven’t changed much in the last few decades, 
hook-up culture is now at the center of the institution 
of higher education because it is thick, palpable. . . 
Counterargument paragraph: “The topic of my 
book, then, isn’t just hooking up; it’s hook-up culture. . 
.” (Wade). 
A template for a counterargument 
paragraph 
I recognize that others may have a different perspective 
than [state your claim*]. They might believe that [state 
their claim]. They believe this because [provide several 
sentences of support]. However, [restate your claim and 
148  |  4C. BODY PARAGRAPHS
explain in several sentences why you believe the way you 
do]. 
*You can also consider counterpoints to your reasoning, 
evidence, or standpoint. 
 
4C. BODY PARAGRAPHS  |  149
Step Four: Decide where to organize 
your counterargument paragraph 
150  |  4C. BODY PARAGRAPHS
Counterargument 
Examples 
An effective counterargument 
does not just say “someone 
might disagree,” but attempts 
to be specific: who (ideally 
someone like your reader) 
might disagree and why? What 
can you say that acknowledges 
their concerns but shows that 
your idea is still convincing? 
Some essays naturally 
acknowledge the 
counterargument all the way 
through because they’re 
proposing a change, which 
means the current situation is 
already a counterargument. In 
this case, it makes sense to 
address the counterargument 
early on: Why are things this 
way now? What’s wrong with 
it? Then consider if someone 
might agree that things should 
change but disagree about your 
course of action. 
Example 1: The current 
method of ranking college 
basketball teams came into 
existence because. . . (This 
paragraph would likely be in 
the beginning.) 
Example 2: Some college 
basketball fans might think that 
while the rankings aren’t 
completely correct in 
predicting winnings, they’re 
more complicated than I’m 
allowing for in this discussion; 
this idea merits consideration 
but does not ultimately derail 
my argument. (This 
counterargument might come 
near the beginning, too, 
because it discusses a potential 
flaw in the basic idea: someone 
might disagree that the 
problem is as bad as I’m saying. 
In this case, it’s likely good to 
talk about that early on, 
because if a reader thinks this 
they will probably not read all 
the way to page four to see you 
address their concern. Also 
note how this topic sentence 
ends by saying how the 
paragraph will end: with my 
idea still being better.) 
4C. BODY PARAGRAPHS  |  151
If my counterargument is X, 
then where in the essay 
should it go? 
If your topic doesn’t seem very 
controversial on its face. . . 
consider putting the 
counterargument in the 
beginning, to establish the 
controversy. 
If your counterargument is 
similar to one of your best 
points in the body of the essay. . 
. 
maybe put the 
counterargument paragraph 
before that body paragraph so 
your response logically leads 
into the next paragraph about a 
similar point. 
If you have several 
counterarguments paragraphs 
you want to include. . . 
you could put them 
throughout the body. 
If you have one solid 
counterargument paragraph 
but a couple of other opposed 
points you want to mention. . . 
you can address those points in 
other paragraphs where they fit 
most closely, including in a 
context paragraph and the 
regular evidentiary body 
paragraphs. 
If none of those seems 
true—it’s just another 
paragraph that could come 
anywhere—. . . 
reconsider your overall 
structure and find the place 
where this information needs to 
come. What do readers need to 
know first? Why? What needs 
to come later? 
Being aware of different perspectives can also help you develop 
152  |  4C. BODY PARAGRAPHS
your conclusion paragraph. In your conclusion, you can 
reaffirm your claim and then: 
• amend part of your claim 
• qualify your claim 
• complicate your claim 
• open up your claim 
 
Writing as collaboration 
Think of adding in counterarguments or different perspectives 
as collaborating with others on addressing an issue. . .

4D. INTRODUCTION AND 
CONCLUSION 
PARAGRAPHS 
Introductions: Getting Readers 
to Bite 
The first sentence of every essay, poem, or novel is perhaps the 
most important because a reader will immediately use the first 
sentence to develop impressions and make assumptions about 
a writer’s style, voice, and purpose. Thoughtful writers begin 
every piece of writing with a unique lure (or hook) that will 
attract the attention of readers and entice them to “bite” (read 
an essay or listen to an idea). Startling examples, surprising 
statistics, and sophisticated questions are a few effective 
strategies for opening sentences of academic essays. 
Quotations can be useful if they are relevant to the topic and 
will be referenced elsewhere in the essay. Generic statements 
like “Throughout history,” and other clichés like “according to 
the dictionary” should be avoided for most essays unless you 
are using them to make a specific point for a specific audience 
and purpose. 
 
Beginning with your first sentence, the goal of an introduction 
is to guide readers toward your thesis. You can effectively guide 
readers from your opening sentence to your working thesis 
summarizing your topic, identifying important authors or 
sources you will be analyzing or referencing, and sharing the 
question at issue that your thesis seeks to answer. 
Introductions: Developing 
Context and a Thesis 
A thesis is a focused sentence that provides your reader with 
your interpretation of a topic or text and the primary 
reasoning or evidence that supports your position. Context is 
information about your topic that you want to make sure your 
audience knows upfront so they can understand the argument 
you are trying to make in your thesis. Consider the audience 
and purpose of your writing task and whether you are writing 
to a general, specialized, or very specific set of readers. 
Developing context forms a connection between the creative 
flourish of your opening lines and the clarity and concision of 
your thesis. 
A thesis provides your reader a controlling idea and main point 
of focus as they read through the body paragraphs and 
conclusion of an essay.  What makes a thesis focused? 
156  |  4D. INTRODUCTION AND CONCLUSION PARAGRAPHS
A thesis is focused when it is: 
• Specific. A thesis for a book may consider a broad topic 
but multi-paragraph essays require writers to 
concentrate on narrow topics in order to develop depth 
in their reasoning and evidence. Considering the 
audience and purpose of your task and developing 
questions at issue can help you pinpoint the one thing 
you really want your readers to take away from your 
essay. 
• Concise. A thesis statement must be concise enough to 
develop a complex and intellectually rigorous perspective 
on your topic in a coherent and efficient sentence or two. 
Concision in a thesis can become a tool for the writer to 
help them stay organized while developing arguments 
and counterarguments. 
• Debatable. A thesis must present a position or point of 
view on topic rather than a restatement of fact or 
observation. Ask yourself, could any reasonable reader 
within my discourse community reasonably disagree 
with my thesis? Supporting the claim of your thesis with 
reasoning and evidence will help you develop its 
debatable aspects. Sharing your working thesis with 
classmates and others will help you determine whether 
everyone already agrees with you or not. 
• Demonstrable. For any claim you make in your thesis, 
you must be able to show the reader the primary reason 
4D. INTRODUCTION AND CONCLUSION PARAGRAPHS  |  157
and evidence that supports your position or 
interpretation. Worthy arguments are backed by 
examples and details. Be sure you can demonstrate each 
reason you use to support your claim within the 
required length of your essay or writing task. 
• Assertive. Remember that making an argument in an 
essay does not prevent you from shifting your 
perspective at a later date. Write with the confidence that 
you belong and are welcome in the conversation you are 
entering. Take a stance that provokes your readers to 
shift their perspective on this topic and show that you 
care about your topic. 
• Readers appreciate directness and sincerity. When 
writing academic essays, there is no need to use phrases 
like I feel, I believe, or in my opinion because the they are 
unnecessary and may irritate your audience. Please note 
that this advice is not intended to discourage you from 
using personal examples in your essays if appropriate for 
your writing task. 
 
Dog lovers, get your counterarguments ready. The three 
examples below provide a basic example of how to develop a 
focused thesis: 
• Not a thesis: Cats are smarter than dogs. 
158  |  4D. INTRODUCTION AND CONCLUSION PARAGRAPHS
The example sentence is a claim but not a thesis because it 
provides no reasoning or evidence to support the claim. 
Opinions like “I think everyone should take the bus to work 
twice a week” only become thesis statements when they are 
supported with reasoning or evidence.  Without reasoning or 
evidence, a person reading this example thesis would have very 
little sense of how the writer will defend this claim or why the 
writer thinks that cats are smarter than dogs 
 
• Unfocused thesis: Cats are smarter than dogs because 
they can learn how to use a litterbox, rarely run away 
from home, and are less clingy and more independent 
than dogs. 
The second example sentence is off to a better start than the 
first example because it makes a claim and also provides 
reasoning and evidence to support the claim. However, there 
are too many reasons to develop in a relatively short essay and 
some of the evidence may be difficult to research or defend. 
Developing a working thesis, even at the preliminary stages of 
a writing project, can provide you with purpose and a place to 
start as you begin to outline and draft your essays. 
 
• A Focused Thesis: Cats are smarter dogs because they 
4D. INTRODUCTION AND CONCLUSION PARAGRAPHS  |  159
can learn how to use a litterbox. 
The third example may not be perfect but presents a position 
on the topic and narrows the focus of the topic sufficiently to 
continue the writing process. In this case, there will certainly 
be dog-lovers ready to provide counterarguments and 
alternative perspectives. 
 
Power words 
Power words like because, although, therefore, since, despite, 
rather than, more than, less than, along with, and considering 
that are all examples of transitional and metacognitive word 
and phrases that can be used to create specificity and 
complexity in a thesis. Try using different kinds of power 
words as you draft your thesis statement to help you connect 
your claim with your primary reason or evidence for making 
the claim. While there is no singular method or formula for 
writing the perfect thesis for every paper, developing a solid 
working thesis for an academic essay can help you be more 
efficient while researching, outlining, drafting, and revising. A 
great thesis will crystalize your idea for you reader and help 
them remember the most important thing you want them to 
take away from your essays. 
 
160  |  4D. INTRODUCTION AND CONCLUSION PARAGRAPHS
Conclusions 
Conclusions 
merit 
consideration 
right 
alongside 
introductions because the two types of paragraphs (or sections 
of longer essays) perform similar functions. Conclusions and 
introductions both summarize, contextualize, condense, and 
synthesize the main ideas you hope to convey to your readers. 
Conclusions discuss the implications of the thesis, defend the 
organization of the essay, and leave the reader with something 
to mull over without distracting them with new information 
about the topic. Writers often reach the final paragraph and 
feel tired or stressed as the clock ticks away toward a deadline. 
Having composed your introduction and body paragraphs to 
demonstrate your thesis, what is left to say but “That’s all 
folks! Thanks for reading!”  Writing effective conclusions that 
do not simply restate but demonstrate the significance and 
implications of your thesis statement can help you to leave 
a lasting impact on any audience. Here are some tips for 
ensuring that lasting impact is positive. 
 
Effective conclusions: 
• Tie together the threads of body paragraph reasoning 
and evidence to help readers understand how a writer 
has demonstrated their thesis 
4D. INTRODUCTION AND CONCLUSION PARAGRAPHS  |  161
• Rephrase rather than directly restate the thesis 
(especially in relation to any alternative or opposing 
perspectives you explored) 
• Consider the broader implications and/or limitations of 
assertions, reasoning, and evidence 
• Circle the reader back to the opening sentence to create a 
sense of closure 
 
Ineffective Conclusions: 
• Contradict or change a thesis (this can occur through 
awkward transition sentences or mean that you need to 
revise your thesis and introduction to reflect your final 
thoughts) 
• Restate the thesis word for word without explaining 
how it has been demonstrated 
• Introduce new lines of reasoning and sources of evidence 
• Demonstrate disregard for alternative or opposing 
perspectives on the topic 
• Begin with generic transition statements like “in 
conclusion” 
162  |  4D. INTRODUCTION AND CONCLUSION PARAGRAPHS
Key Takeaways 
• Introductions and conclusions create your first 
and last impression on readers. 
• Academic essays require a thesis statement to 
provide your audience with a clear sense of 
your position, opinion, perspective on a topic, 
rather than a summary of the topic. 
• A focused thesis is specific, precise, debatable,

5A. SHARING 
Sharing and Reviewing 
After working closely with a piece of writing, writers often 
need to step back and ask for a more objective reader. What 
writers most need is feedback from readers who can respond 
only to the words on the page. When they are ready, writers 
show their drafts to someone they respect and who can give an 
honest response about its strengths and weaknesses. 
You, too, can ask a peer to read your draft when it is ready. 
Providing your peer reviewers with questions you would like 
them to consider, areas you would like them to focus on, or 
other things you would like feedback on will help your 
reviewer provide more constructive feedback.  After evaluating 
the feedback and assessing what is most helpful, the reader’s 
feedback will help you when you revise your draft. This 
process is called peer review and is used by professors and other 
professionals to share ideas, receive feedback, and prepare 
essays for revision and publication. 
You can work with a partner in your class and identify specific 
ways to strengthen each other’s essays. Although you may be 
uncomfortable sharing your writing at first, remember that 
each writer is working toward the same goal: a final draft that 
fits the audience and the purpose. Maintaining a positive 
attitude when providing feedback will put you and your 
partner at ease. The box that follows provides a useful 
framework for the peer review session.

Writing Labs and Tutors 
Most colleges and universities offer students additional writing 
coaching and tutoring through writing centers, tutoring, 
centers, accessible education centers, multicultural centers, 
and/or services for student athletes. In most cases, writing 
coaching, tutoring, and online writing labs are free to students. 
Writing coaches typically focus their sessions on content, 
organization, and structure issues rather than grammar, 
spelling, and punctuation. (Please do not ask a writing tutor 
to edit your grammar for you as if they are a proofreader!) 
Prepare questions for your tutor in advance and bring your 
writing task instructions and other useful information so they 
can provide the best possible feedback and guidance. Ask your 
instructor if your school has a writing or tutoring center if you 
are unsure. 
 
Using Feedback Objectively 
The purpose of peer feedback is to receive constructive 
criticism of your essay. Your peer reviewer is your first real 
audience, and you have the opportunity to learn what confuses 
and delights a reader so that you can improve your work before 
sharing the final draft with a wider audience (or your intended 
audience). 
170  |  5A. SHARING
It may not be necessary to incorporate every recommendation 
your peer reviewer makes. However, if you start to observe a 
pattern in the responses you receive from peer reviewers, you 
might want to take that feedback into consideration in future 
assignments. For example, if you read consistent comments 
about a need for more research, then you may want to consider 
including more research in future assignments. 
 
Using Feedback from Multiple 
Sources 
You might get feedback from more than one reader as you 
share different stages of your revised draft. In this situation, 
you may receive feedback from readers who do not understand 
the assignment or who lack your involvement with and 
enthusiasm for it. 
You need to evaluate the responses you receive according to 
two important criteria: 
1. Determine if the feedback supports the purpose of the 
assignment. 
2. Determine if the suggested revisions are appropriate to 
the audience. 
5A. SHARING  |  171
5B. REVISING 
Revising and editing are the two tasks you undertake to 
significantly improve your essay. Both are very important 
elements of the writing process. You may think that a 
completed first draft means little improvement is needed. 
However, even experienced writers need to improve their 
drafts and rely on peers during revising and editing. You may 
know that athletes miss catches, fumble balls, or overshoot 
goals. Dancers forget steps, turn too slowly, or miss beats. For 
both athletes and dancers, the more they practice, the stronger 
their performance will become. Web designers seek better 
images, a more clever design, or a more appealing background 
for their web pages. Writing has the same capacity to profit 
from improvement and revision. Published writing is typically 
revised and edited multiple times before it reaches the page 
or screen. The lessons in this section will help you appreciate 
that good writers may put as much or even far more time into 
revising and editing an essay as they do into writing a first draft. 
 
Understanding the Purpose of 
Revising 
Revising and editing allow you to examine two important 
aspects of your writing separately, so that you can give each 
task your undivided attention. 
• When you revise, you share your work with peers, 
writing coaches, instructors and other trusted readers 
and self-reflect to take a second look at your ideas. You 
might add, cut, move, or change information in order to 
make your ideas clearer, more accurate, more interesting, 
or more convincing. 
 
Strategies for Revision 
How do you get the best out of your revisions and editing? 
Here are some strategies that writers have developed to look 
at their first drafts from a fresh perspective. Try them over the 
course of this semester; then keep using the ones that bring 
results. 
• Plan time between your first draft and your deadline. 
You are proud of what you wrote, but you might be too 
5B. REVISING  |  173
close to it to make changes. Set aside your writing for a 
few hours or days until you can look at it objectively. 
• Ask someone you trust for feedback and constructive 
criticism. 
• Pretend you are one of your readers or a journal editor. 
Would they be satisfied or dissatisfied? 
• Use the resources that your college provides. Find out 
where your school’s writing lab is located and ask about 
the assistance they provide online and in person. 
• Develop “thick skin.” Accepting criticism and seeking 
praise can be emotionally taxing. 
• Use the feedback you receive to complete a “reverse 
outline” of your first draft, creating a guide you can 
follow while you write your second draft. 
Many people hear the words critique and criticism and pick 
up only negative vibes that provoke feelings that make them 
blush, grumble, or shout. However, as a writer and a thinker, 
you need to learn to be critical of yourself in a positive way and 
have high expectations for your work. You also need to train 
your eye and trust your ability to fix what needs fixing. You 
may receive different feedback from various reviewers and have 
to trust your instincts while revising your work. 
 
Revising for Unity and 
174  |  5B. REVISING
Coherence 
Creating an outline that you can follow closely offers you a 
reasonable guarantee that your writing will stay on purpose 
and not drift away from the controlling idea. However, when 
writers are rushed, are tired, or cannot find the right words or 
quotations their writing may become underdeveloped and flat. 
Their writing may no longer be clear and concise, and they 
may be adding information that is not needed to develop the 
main idea. Revising for overall unity and coherence is a great 
place to begin. 
When a piece of writing has unity, all the ideas in each 
paragraph and in the entire essay clearly belong and are 
arranged in an order that makes logical sense. When the 
writing has coherence, the ideas flow smoothly. The wording 
clearly indicates how one idea leads to another within a 
paragraph and from paragraph to paragraph. 
 
Transitions 
What this section is about 
In this crazy, mixed-up world of ours, transitions glue our 
ideas and our essays together. This section will introduce you 
5B. REVISING  |  175
to some useful transitional expressions and help you employ 
them effectively. 
The function and importance of 
transitions 
In both academic writing and professional writing, your goal is 
to convey information clearly and concisely, if not to convert 
the reader to your way of thinking. Transitions help you to 
achieve these goals by establishing logical connections between 
sentences, paragraphs, and sections of your papers. In other 
words, transitions tell readers what to do with the information 
you present to them. Whether single words, quick phrases, or 
full sentences, they function as signs that tell readers how to 
think about, organize, and react to old and new ideas as they 
read through what you have written. 
Transitions signal relationships between ideas—relationships 
such as: “Another example coming up—stay alert!” or “Here’s 
an exception to my previous statement” or “Although this idea 
appears to be true, here’s the real story.” Basically, transitions 
provide the reader with directions for how to piece together 
your ideas into a logically coherent argument. Transitions are 
not just verbal decorations that embellish your paper by 
making it sound or read better. They are words with particular 
meanings that tell the reader to think and react in a particular 
way to your ideas. In providing the reader with these 
176  |  5B. REVISING
important cues, transitions help readers understand the logic 
of how your ideas fit together. 
Signs that you might need to work on your 
transitions 
How can you tell whether you need to work on your 
transitions? Here are some possible clues: 
• Your instructor has written comments like “choppy,” 
“jumpy,” “abrupt,” “flow,” “need signposts,” or “how is 
this related?” on your papers. 
• Your readers (instructors, friends, or classmates) tell you 
that they had trouble following your organization or 
train of thought. 
• You tend to write the way you think—and your brain 
often jumps from one idea to another pretty quickly. 
• You wrote your paper in several discrete “chunks” and 
then pasted them together. 
• You are working on a group paper; the draft you are 
working on was created by pasting pieces of several 
people’s writing together. 
 
Organization 
Since the clarity and effectiveness of your transitions will 
5B. REVISING  |  177
depend greatly on how well you have organized your paper, 
you may want to evaluate your paper’s organization before you 
work on transitions. In the margins of your draft, summarize 
in a word or short phrase what each paragraph is about or how 
it fits into your analysis as a whole. This exercise should help 
you to see the order of and connection between your ideas 
more clearly. 
If after doing this exercise you find that you still have difficulty 
linking your ideas together in a coherent fashion, your 
problem may not be with transitions but with organization. 
For help in this area (and a more thorough explanation of 
the “reverse outlining” technique described in the previous 
paragraph), please see the [University of North Carolina] 
Writing Center’s handout on organization. 
 
How transitions work 
The organization of your written work includes two elements: 
(1) the order in which you have chosen to present the different 
parts of your discussion or argument, and (2) the relationships 
you construct between these parts. Transitions cannot 
substitute for good organization, but they can make your 
organization clearer and easier to follow. Take a look at the 
following example: 
178  |  5B. REVISING
El Pais, a Latin American country, has a new democratic 
government after having been a dictatorship for many years. 
Assume that you want to argue that El Pais is not as democratic 
as the conventional view would have us believe. 
One way to effectively organize your argument would be to 
present the conventional view and then to provide the reader 
with your critical response to this view. So, in Paragraph A you 
would enumerate all the reasons that someone might consider 
El Pais highly democratic, while in Paragraph B you would 
refute these points. The transition that would establish the 
logical connection between these two key elements of your 
argument would indicate to the reader that the information 
in paragraph B contradicts the information in paragraph A. 
As a result, you might organize your argument, including the 
transition that links paragraph A with paragraph B, in the 
following manner: 
Paragraph A: points that support the view that El Pais’s new 
government is very democratic. 
Transition: Despite the previous arguments, there are many 
reasons to think that El Pais’s new government is not as 
democratic as typically believed. 
Paragraph B: points that contradict the view that El Pais’s 
new government is very democratic. 
In this case, the transition words “Despite the previous 
5B. REVISING  |  179
arguments,” suggest that the reader should not believe 
paragraph A and instead should consider the writer’s reasons 
for viewing El Pais’s democracy as suspect. 
As the example suggests, transitions can help reinforce the 
underlying logic of your paper’s organization by providing the 
reader with essential information regarding the relationship 
between your ideas. In this way, transitions act as the glue that 
binds the components of your argument or discussion into a 
unified, coherent, and persuasive whole. 
 
Types of transitions 
Now that you have a general idea of how to go about 
developing effective transitions in your writing, let us briefly 
discuss the types of transitions your writing will use. 
The types of transitions available to you are as diverse as the 
circumstances in which you need to use them. A transition can 
be a single word, a phrase, a sentence, or an entire paragraph. 
In each case, it functions the same way: First, the transition 
either directly summarizes the content of a preceding sentence, 
paragraph, or section or implies such a summary (by 
reminding the reader of what has come before). Then, it helps 
the reader anticipate or comprehend the new information that 
you wish to present. 
180  |  5B. REVISING
1. Transitions between sections: Particularly in longer 
works, it may be necessary to include transitional 
paragraphs that summarize for the reader the 
information just covered and specify the relevance of this 
information to the discussion in the following section. 
2. Transitions between paragraphs: If you have done a 
good job of arranging paragraphs so that the content of 
one leads logically to the next, the transition will 
highlight a relationship that already exists by 
summarizing the previous paragraph and suggesting 
something of the content of the paragraph that follows. 
A transition between paragraphs can be a word or two 
(however, for example, similarly), a phrase, or a sentence. 
Transitions can be at the end of the first paragraph, at 
the beginning of the second paragraph, or in both places. 
3. Transitions within paragraphs: As with transitions 
between sections and paragraphs, transitions within 
paragraphs act as cues by helping readers to anticipate 
what is coming before they read it. Within paragraphs, 
transitions tend to be single words or short phrases. 
Transitional expressions 
Effectively constructing each transition often depends upon 
your ability to identify words or phrases that will indicate for 
the reader the kind of logical relationships you want to convey. 
The table below should make it easier for you to find these 
5B. REVISING  |  181
words or phrases. Whenever you have trouble finding a word, 
phrase, or sentence to serve as an effective transition, refer to 
the information in the table for assistance. Look in the left 
column of the table for the kind of logical relationship you 
are trying to express. Then look in the right column of the 
table for examples of words or phrases that express this logical 
relationship. 
Keep in mind that each of these words or phrases may have 
a slightly different meaning. Consult a dictionary or writer’s 
handbook if you are unsure of the exact meaning of a word or 
phrase.

5B. REVISING  |  183
Keep in mind that transitional words and expressions are used 
at the beginning and end of paragraphs to guide readers from 
the flow of one significant idea to the next. They are used in 
combination with topic sentences, reasoning, evidence, and 
analysis to build effective paragraphs. Phrases like “in 
conclusion” may be useful within paragraphs but are less 
creative and interesting than transitioning more fluidly into 
your final paragraph from the one that precedes it. 
 
Clarity and Concision 
Some writers are very methodical and painstaking when they 
write a first draft. Other writers unleash a storm of words in 
order to get out all their ideas at once. Do either of these 
composing styles match your approach? Or is your composing 
style somewhere in between? No matter which description 
best fits you, the first draft of almost every piece of writing, no 
matter its author, can be made clearer and more concise. 
If you have a tendency to write too much, you will need to look 
for unnecessary words. If you have a tendency to be vague or 
imprecise in your wording, you will need to find specific words 
to replace any overly general language. 
 
184  |  5B. REVISING
Identifying Wordiness 
Sometimes writers use too many words when fewer words will 
appeal more to their audience and better fit their purpose. 
Here are some common examples of wordiness to look for in 
your draft. Eliminating wordiness helps all readers, because it 
makes your ideas clear, direct, and straightforward. 
• Sentences that begin with There is or There are. 
Wordy: There are two major experiments that the Biology 
Department sponsors. 
Revised: The Biology Department sponsors two major 
experiments. 
 
• Sentences with unnecessary modifiers. 
Wordy: Two extremely famous and well-known consumer 
advocates spoke eloquently in favor of the proposed important 
legislation. 
Revised: Two well-known consumer advocates spoke in favor 
of the proposed legislation. 
 
5B. REVISING  |  185
• Sentences with deadwood phrases that add little to 
the meaning. Be judicious when you use phrases such 
as in terms of, with a mind to, on the subject of, as to 
whether or not, more or less, as far as…is concerned, and 
similar expressions. You can usually find a more 
straightforward way to state your point. 
Wordy: As a world leader in the field of green technology, the 
company plans to focus its efforts in the area of geothermal 
energy. 
A report as to whether or not to use geysers as an energy source 
is in the process of preparation. 
Revised: As a world leader in green technology, the company 
plans to focus on geothermal energy. 
A report about using geysers as an energy source is in 
preparation. 
 
• Sentences in the passive voice or with forms of the 
verb to be. Sentences with passive-voice verbs often 
create confusion, because the subject of the sentence 
does not perform an action. Sentences are clearer when 
the subject of the sentence performs the action and is 
followed by a strong verb. Use strong active-voice verbs 
in place of forms of to be, which can lead to wordiness. 
186  |  5B. REVISING
Avoid passive voice when you can. 
Wordy: It might perhaps be said that using a GPS device is 
something that is a benefit to drivers who have a poor sense of 
direction. 
Revised: Drivers who have a poor sense of direction benefit 
from using a GPS device. 
 
• Sentences with wordy constructions that can be 
shortened. 
Wordy: The e-book reader, which is a recent invention, may 
have become as commonplace as the cell phone; even my over-
sixty uncle and his wife just bought one of those. 
Revised: 
E-book

Choosing Specific, Appropriate 
Words to suit your Audience and 
Purpose 
Most college essays should be written in formal English 
5B. REVISING  |  187
suitable for an academic situation. Follow these principles and 
check with your instructors to be sure that your word choice 
and tone of voice are appropriate. 
• Avoid slang and derogatory language. Find 
alternatives to words like huge, dope, awesome, and sucks 
that may be unfamiliar, upsetting, or insulting to your 
readers. 
• Use formal rather than casual words. Write about 
“men and women” rather than “gals and guys” unless 
you are trying to create a specific effect. A formal tone 
calls for formal language. Inclusive terms like they and 
folks may also be preferable to gendered pronouns. 
• Use contractions strategically. Contractions combine 
two words into a single word, such as replacing do not 
with don’t, I am with I’m, have not with haven’t, and so 
on. Contractions can be effective for establishing style 
and tone but overuse can be considered too informal for 
academic writing. 
• Avoid clichés. Overused expressions such as green with 
envy, face the music, better late than never, and similar 
expressions are empty of meaning and may not appeal to 
your audience. 
• Be mindful of words that sound alike but have 
different meanings. Some examples are allusion/
illusion, complement/compliment, council/counsel, 
concurrent/consecutive, founder/flounder, and historic/
188  |  5B. REVISING
historical. When in doubt, check a dictionary. 
• Choose words with the connotations you want. 
Choosing a word for its connotations is as important in 
formal essay writing as it is in all kinds of writing. 
Compare the positive connotations of the word proud 
and the negative connotations of arrogant and conceited. 
• Use specific words suited to your audience and 
purpose rather than overly general words. Find 
synonyms for things, people, nice, good, bad, interesting, 
and other vague words. Or use specific details to make 
your exact meaning clear. Use a thesaurus to look up 
synonyms to develop your vocabulary but be mindful 
that not all synonyms mean exactly the same thing.

that makes logical sense. 
• Coherence in writing means that the writer’s 
wording clearly indicates how one idea leads 
to another within a paragraph and between 
paragraphs. 
• Transitional words and phrases effectively 
make writing more coherent.

5C. EDITING + 
FORMATTING 
When you edit, you take a closer look at your revisions as a 
reader rather than writer. At this stage in the writing process, 
try to step back from your ideas and focus just on individual 
words and sentences. You add or change words. You fix any 
problems in grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure. 
You improve your writing style. You make your essay into a 
polished, mature piece of writing, the end product of your best 
efforts. 
If you have been incorporating feedback and making revisions, 
you have produced multiple drafts of your writing. So far, 
all your changes have been content changes. Perhaps with the 
help of peer feedback, you have made sure that you sufficiently 
supported your ideas. You have checked for problems with 
unity and coherence. You have examined your essay for word 
choice, revising to cut unnecessary words and to replace weak 
wording with specific and appropriate wording. 
The final step after revising the content is editing. When you 
edit, you examine the surface features of your text. You 
examine your spelling, grammar, usage, and punctuation. You 
also make sure you use the proper format when creating your 
finished assignment. 
Plan Time for Editing 
Editing takes time. Budgeting time into the writing process 
allows you to complete additional edits after revising. Editing 
and proofreading your writing helps you create a finished work 
that represents your best efforts. Here are a few more tips to 
remember about your readers: 
• Readers do not notice correct spelling, but they do 
notice misspellings. 
• Readers look past your sentences to get to your 
ideas—unless the sentences are awkward, poorly 
constructed, and frustrating to read. 
• Readers notice when every sentence has the same rhythm 
as every other sentence, with no variety. 
• Readers do not cheer when you use there, their, and 
they’re correctly, but they notice when you do not. 
• Readers will notice the care with which you handled 
your assignment and your attention to detail in the 
delivery of an error-free document..

Editors Checklist 
Grammar 
• Are some sentences actually sentence fragments? 
• Are some sentences run-on sentences? How can I correct 
them? 
• Do some sentences need conjunctions between 
independent clauses? 
• Does every verb agree with its subject? 
• Is every verb in the correct tense? 
• Are tense forms, especially for irregular verbs, written 
correctly? 
• Have I used subject, object, and possessive personal 
pronouns correctly? 
• Have I used who and whom correctly? 
• Is the antecedent of every pronoun clear? 
• Do all personal pronouns agree with their antecedents? 
• Have I used the correct comparative and superlative 
forms of adjectives and adverbs? 
• Is it clear which word a participial phrase modifies, or is 
it a dangling modifier? 
Sentence Structure 
• Are all my sentences simple sentences, or do I vary my 
sentence structure? 
194  |  5C. EDITING + FORMATTING
• Have I chosen the best coordinating or subordinating 
conjunctions to join clauses? 
• Have I created long, overpacked sentences that should be 
shortened for clarity? 
• Do I see any mistakes in parallel structure? 
Punctuation 
• Does every sentence end with the correct end 
punctuation? 
• Can I justify the use of every exclamation point? 
• Have I used apostrophes correctly to write all singular 
and plural possessive forms? 
• Have I used quotation marks correctly? 
Mechanics and Usage 
• Can I find any spelling errors? How can I correct them? 
• Have I used capital letters where they are needed? 
• Have I written abbreviations, where allowed, correctly? 
• Can I find any errors in the use of commonly confused 
words, such as to/too/two? 
NOTE: If you’re unsure about some of these issues, a quick 
internet search should help you find several pages that will 
guide you in the right direction.

Be careful about relying too much on spelling checkers and 
grammar checkers. A spelling checker cannot recognize that 
you meant to write principle but wrote principal instead. A 
grammar checker often queries constructions that are perfectly 
correct. The program does not understand your meaning; it 
makes its check against a general set of formulas that might 
not apply in each instance. If you use a grammar checker, 
accept the suggestions that make sense, but consider why the 
suggestions came up. 
 
Proofreading requires patience; it is very easy to read past a 
mistake. Set your paper aside for at least a few hours, if not 
a day or more, so your mind will rest. Some professional 
proofreaders read a text backward so they can concentrate on 
spelling and punctuation. Another helpful technique is to 
slowly read a paper aloud, paying attention to every word, 
letter, and punctuation mark. If you need additional 
proofreading help, ask a reliable friend, a classmate, or a peer 
tutor to make a final pass on your paper to look for anything 
you missed.

Formatting 
Remember to use proper format when creating your finished 
assignment. Sometimes an instructor, a department, or a 
college will require students to follow specific instructions on 
titles, margins, page numbers, or the location of the writer’s 
name. These requirements may be more detailed and rigid 
for research projects and term papers, which often adhere to 
American Psychological Association (APA) or Modern 
Language Association (MLA) style guides, especially when 
citations of sources are included. 
Citation style guides are updated regularly. The publishing 
industry and academics use a wide-variety of standardized 
formatting and citation styles, including MLA, APA, Chicago, 
Harvard and more. First-year writing instructors typically 
prefer MLA citation style, however, always check with your 
instructor for any class regarding their preferred or required 
citation style. For current information on citation style guides, 
the following links may be useful: 
• The Purdue University Online Writing Lab (OWL): 
nationally recognized leader in providing a 
comprehensive, up-to-day citation guide website for 
students and instructors.

• MLA (Modern Language Association) Style Guide: 
nationally recognized guide for publication formatting 
in the humanities. 
 
• APA (American Psychological Association) Style Guide: 
nationally recognized guide for publication formatting 
in the sciences and social sciences. 
 
To ensure the format, style, and citations are correct and follow 
any specific instructions, make a final check before you submit 
any writing assignment. 
5c. Key Takeaways 
• During editing, you take a second look at the 
words and sentences you used to express 
your ideas and fix any problems in grammar, 
punctuation, sentence structure, and 
198  |  5C. EDITING + FORMATTING
formatting. 
• Budget time for editing and proofreading. Use 
all available resources, including editing 
checklists, peer editing, and your institution’s 
writing lab, to improve your writing. 
 
Dress for Success: Formatting

Think about your dress

5C. EDITING + FORMATTING  |  199
 
Think about your dress 
style when you 
interview for a job. 
Do you dress differently? Why do you dress differently? 
You might dress differently depending on the situation and 
community. 
It’s the same with your writing. You might adopt different 
writing styles depending on the situation and community. 
How you format your essay also depends on the situation and 
community. 
MLA vs. APA 
As the Yale Poorvu Center for Teaching and Learning 
explains: 
“The first two styles are known as “in-text” citation styles, 
200  |  5C. EDITING + FORMATTING
which means that you give some information about the source 
directly after the quotation, but leave the rest to a list of 
References (APA) or Works Cited (MLA) at the end of the 
paper. (1) MLA style, defined by the Modern Language 
Association, is most common in the humanities. Because 
humanities research highlights how one piece of writing 
influences another, MLA style emphasizes the author’s name 
and the page in the original text you’re using. This information 
allows scholars to track down easily the exact sentences you’re 
analyzing. (2) APA style, defined by the American 
Psychological Association, is most common in the social 
sciences. Although the author’s name is an important element 
in APA citations, this style emphasizes the year the source was 
published, rather than the page number, which allows a reader 
to see quickly how the research you’re writing about has 
evolved over time.”

Another style you may have heard of is Chicago Style, which is 
used in business fields and for publishing. 
Why is formatting your paper to 
MLA important? 
• Cite the sources you use 
• Help an interested reader find the sources you reference 
• Consistency and continuity: “branding” your paper 
• Situates your essay within humanities scholarship and 
the humanities community 
• “Nice suit!” – it’s part of presenting yourself 
professionally 
• Skills you hone: polish, patience, proficiency

format your essay 
1. Every place you summarize, paraphrase, or quote a specific 
passage, section, idea, or statistic from a source: 
◦ Provide a parenthetical in-text citation 
▪ Ex. “For to survive in the mouth of this 
dragon we call america, we have had to learn 
this first and most vital lesson—that we [Black 
women] were never meant to survive” (Lorde 
42). 
▪ Ex. Audre Lorde’s “poems and prose largely 
deal with issues related to civil rights, 
feminism, lesbianism, illness and disability, 
and the exploration of black female identity” 
(Wikipedia). 
2. Works Cited page 
◦ A new page 
3. A great title for your essay! 
◦ Still not sure? Use your essay’s question at issue as 
the title.
